## [Unreleased]

## [0.17.5] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **RDP session aborts when resized** ([#200](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/200)) — resizing an embedded IronRDP session (e.g. toggling the sidebar with F9) triggers a Deactivation-Reactivation Sequence; the reactivation handler rebuilt the FastPath processor with `bulk_decompressor: None`, but the server keeps bulk compression enabled across the resize. The next compressed FastPath update then logged `Received compressed FastPath data but no decompressor is configured` and the undecodable payload aborted the session with `Protocol error: Session error: [Fast-Path …] custom error`, dropping the connection. The handler now rebuilds a fresh decompressor for the negotiated compression type (RDP4/5/6/6.1) — mirroring `ActiveStage::new` — so compressed updates keep decoding after a resize
- **RDP to GNOME Remote Desktop falls back to FreeRDP instead of dead-ending** ([#199](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/199)) — connecting to a GNOME Remote Desktop (grd) server completed NLA/CredSSP, then IronRDP's connector tripped its own state machine in the capabilities/finalization phase and returned `general_err!("invalid state (this is a bug)")`, surfaced as `Connection finalize failed: … general error`. The in-session error handler's protocol-incompatibility detector only matched the literal `connect_finalize` (which never appears in the message — core wraps it as "Connection finalize failed" and IronRDP renders "invalid state (this is a bug)"), so no FreeRDP fallback fired and the user saw a hard failure even though Remmina/FreeRDP connects fine. The detector now matches the actual wrapper prefix and the upstream bug signature, so these servers transparently fall back to the external FreeRDP client
- **arm64 snap build links against a single pango** ([#198](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/198)) — the native arm64 snap leg failed at the link step with `undefined reference to pango_font_description_{get,set}_features` because ld mixed noble's `libpango-1.0` (from `/usr/lib`) with the gnome-46-2404 SDK's newer `libpangoft2-1.0`. The `snap/snapcraft.yaml` build now prepends the SDK arch-triplet lib dir to the rustc link search path (`RUSTFLAGS -L native=…`), so both halves of pango resolve from the SDK — the same copy used at runtime. amd64 already aligned, so this is a no-op there
- **Variable password auto-login on network equipment** ([#194](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/194)) — the 0.17.4 fix subscribed to VTE `cursor-moved` but still read `.lines().last()` of the full grid, which is empty when the prompt sits above ~20 blank rows (no-echo prompts on OLT/router gear). Detection now reads the line under the cursor (`get_cursor_line_text`, cursor position + `text_range_format`, falling back to the last non-empty grid line) and delegates matching to a pure, testable `looks_like_password_prompt` in `rustconn-core`. An idle re-check (~120 ms, scheduled at most once) covers the race where the signal fires before the prompt glyphs land in the grid. The one-shot injection guard is preserved
- **Jump host authenticates with its own Variable/Vault password** ([#191](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/191)) — the 0.17.2 fix resolved the bastion password only from the vault store key, missing a bastion whose password comes from a Variable source, and skipped the first reference hop entirely when a string `proxy_jump` was also present. The bastion password now resolves via the same `PasswordSource`-aware path as the target (Variable/Vault/cache) and is delivered out-of-band via `SSH_ASKPASS` on the ProxyCommand. A guard ensures the target password is injected into the VTE prompt only when there is no jump host or the bastion was handled out-of-band, so the target password can never leak to the bastion prompt

### Added

- **Terminal control shortcuts reach the session** ([#197](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/197)) — readline chords (Ctrl+F/P/N/W/H/M/I) were intercepted by the application accelerators before reaching the focused terminal. A new setting "Send terminal control shortcuts to the session" (enabled by default) temporarily suspends those single-Ctrl accelerators while the VTE terminal or an embedded RDP/VNC/SPICE viewer has focus, and restores them when focus leaves. `<Control><Shift>` chords and function keys stay active throughout; disabling the setting restores the old always-active behavior
- **Native arm64 snap build** — the Snap package now builds for arm64 (aarch64) alongside amd64 via a parallel CI matrix on native runners (`ubuntu-24.04` + `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, no QEMU). `snap/snapcraft.yaml` declares both platforms and uses architecture-independent `prime:` exclusions so the GTK/GLib deduplication works on arm64. The snap build stays best-effort: a failure of either architecture does not gate the release

### Changed

- **Dependency refresh** — bumped the gtk4-rs stack to the latest compatible patch releases: `gtk4`/`gtk4-sys`/`gtk4-macros` 0.11.4, `gdk4`/`gdk4-sys` 0.11.4, `gdk4-wayland` 0.11.4, `gsk4`/`gsk4-sys` 0.11.4, `graphene-rs`/`graphene-sys` 0.22.8, `gio`/`gio-sys` 0.22.8, `glib`/`glib-sys` 0.22.8, and `pango` 0.22.8. Also updated `hybrid-array` 0.4.13 and `open` 5.3.6, and dropped the now-unused `pathdiff`

## [0.17.4] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **RDP vault login sends the correct domain** ([#188](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/188)) — when credentials came from the secret vault (Tresor), the domain field was passed as an empty string instead of the configured value, causing NLA/CredSSP to reject `DOMAIN\user` logins with `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`. The vault path now falls back to the connection's saved domain, matching the manual-prompt flow
- **Variable password auto-login works on network equipment** ([#194](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/194)) — connections using a Variable password source resolved the secret from the vault correctly but never injected it into the SSH prompt. The password auto-fill relied solely on VTE's `contents-changed` signal, which does not fire reliably for SSH password prompts output in no-echo mode with cursor-positioning escape sequences (common on OLT/router SSH servers). The detection now also subscribes to VTE's `cursor-moved` signal, which fires for all cursor activity including prompts without a trailing newline

### Changed

- **CUPS printer redirection forwards all local queues** ([#192](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/192)) — the embedded IronRDP printer channel previously announced a single dummy "RustConn" printer. It now enumerates all local CUPS queues (or a configured subset via `RdpClientConfig::with_printers`) and registers each as its own redirected printer, routing print jobs back to the correct local queue. The CUPS default printer is announced last so it wins the IronRDP `DEFAULTPRINTER` flag

## [0.17.3] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Switching GNOME workspaces no longer breaks RDP keyboard input** ([#193](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/193)) — pressing `Super`+digit to switch workspace let the GNOME compositor grab the `Super` chord before its key-release reached the RDP widget, so the embedded session kept treating `Super` (and any modifier caught the same way, e.g. via Alt+Tab) as held down, mangling all further input until a full reconnect. The widget now releases every still-pressed key when it loses keyboard focus, so a compositor-grabbed modifier can no longer stick in the remote session
- **RD Gateway connections work again with FreeRDP 3.x** ([#187](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/187)) — the external FreeRDP launcher emitted the FreeRDP 2.x gateway aliases `/g:`, `/gu:` and `/gp:`, which FreeRDP 3.x removed in favour of the unified `/gateway:` option. The 3.x client rejected `/g:` as an "Unexpected keyword" and exited before connecting (exit status 23). The launcher now builds `/gateway:g:<host>:<port>` (matching the working manual `xfreerdp /gateway:g:HOST /u:NAME /d:DOMAIN` command) and lets FreeRDP reuse the session credentials for the gateway. An explicit gateway user is added (`,u:<user>`) only when it differs from the session user; the broken `/gp:` args-file path is removed (a distinct gateway password is not stored yet and remains future work)
- **Multi-hop (double) jump hosts work in Flatpak** — chaining through two or more bastions failed with `Connection closed by UNKNOWN port 65535` (issue #191 follow-up). The inner hops were reached with a plain `-J`, which does not inherit the identity key or the Flatpak-writable `known_hosts` from the outer command, so the second bastion had neither its key nor host-key verification. RustConn now nests a `ProxyCommand` per hop (terminal SSH, RDP/VNC/SPICE tunnels), passing the identity file and `known_hosts` to every hop. The remote-monitoring probe had the same chain bug in a sharper form — it passed the whole comma-joined chain as a single destination host — and is fixed the same way
- **Multi-hop jump host order corrected outside Flatpak** — the plain `-J` path (native builds, terminal SSH, RDP/VNC/SPICE tunnels, and the monitoring probe) joined the bastions in RustConn's internal target-first order, but OpenSSH `-J` visits hops client-first, so a chain of three or more bastions was traversed in reverse and failed to connect. The hop list is now reversed for every `-J` call to match the corrected nested-`ProxyCommand` direction. Single-bastion connections (the common case) are unaffected

### Added

- **RDP printer redirection** — a new "Printer Redirection" toggle (RDP connection editor → Features) maps your local printer into the remote session, so you can print to it from the Windows side (issue #192). For the embedded IronRDP client, RustConn announces a virtual PostScript printer over the RDPDR channel and forwards each print job to the local CUPS spooler (`lp`) on a detached thread, so a large job never stalls the session's framebuffer or input; for the external `xfreerdp3` client it passes `/printer`. The setting is available in the GUI, via the CLI (`rustconn-cli add/update --printer`), and is imported from Windows `.rdp` files (`redirectprinters:i:1`). The template editor does not expose the toggle yet — configure it per connection

### Changed

- **External RDP now prefers the maintained SDL3 FreeRDP client** — client detection put the deprecated `wlfreerdp` first on Wayland sessions, even though FreeRDP 3.x prints a deprecation warning for it and steers users to the SDL3 client (`sdl-freerdp3`). External launches (RD Gateway, RemoteApp fallback, IronRDP fallback) now prefer `sdl-freerdp3`, which is actively maintained and parses the unified `/gateway:` option correctly. Embedded mode still uses `wlfreerdp` directly where present, so the in-tab Wayland-subsurface experience is unchanged

## [0.17.2] - 2026-06-25

A hardening release following a deep, per-feature codebase audit (15 actionable findings).

### Security

- **Generated passwords now auto-clear from the clipboard** — the password generator's "Copy" left the password on the clipboard indefinitely, unlike the connection "Copy Password" action (30 s auto-clear). It now clears after 30 seconds, but only if the clipboard still holds that password (so it never clobbers something you copied since)
- **SSH password no longer lingers in memory after auto-login** — the injected password (initial connect and in-place reconnect) is now wrapped in `Zeroizing` so the plaintext is wiped immediately after it is handed to VTE, instead of remaining in a `String` until garbage collection
- **SSH tunnel askpass file race fixed** — the temporary `SSH_ASKPASS` helper script used a PID-only filename, so concurrent tunnels shared one path and a second `File::create` could truncate the script while the first `ssh` was still reading it. The filename now includes a per-tunnel UUID

### Fixed

- **SSH jump host uses its own password** — connecting through a jump host fed the *target's* password to the bastion prompt, so a bastion with a different password failed (issue #191). The bastion now authenticates with its own saved password, delivered out-of-band so the terminal still prompts for the target password as before. Covers a single jump host with a saved/vault password; chained hops and prompt-only bastions remain future work
- **RDP dynamic resize no longer requests degenerate resolutions** — the debounced resize path sent the new desktop size without the minimum-size guard that the manual "Fit resolution to window" path already had, so a widget caught mid-layout or collapsed could ask the server for a sub-640×480 desktop. The debounced path now applies the same 640×480 floor
- **RD Gateway password is now sent (same-account gateways)** — when a separate RD Gateway *username* is configured, FreeRDP received `/gu:` but no password, so it fell back to an interactive prompt that hangs in the spawned client. The session password is now passed as the gateway password (`/gp:`) through the same single-use, mode-0600 args file used for RemoteApp credentials, so it never appears on the command line. This covers gateways that authenticate against the same account as the session; a fully independent gateway credential remains future work. When no gateway username is set, FreeRDP keeps reusing the session credentials as before
- **RDP shared-folder names with commas no longer corrupt drive redirection** — FreeRDP's `/drive:<name>,<path>` switch is comma-delimited, so a comma in the share name split the argument and broke the mapped path. Share names are now sanitized (commas replaced with `_`) on both external-client paths
- **Multilingual SSH auto-login on reconnect** — in-place reconnect only matched a handful of English password prompts, so auto-login failed on non-English systems after a reconnect. Prompt detection (initial connect and reconnect) is now a single shared `detect_password_prompt()` covering all supported languages

### Added

- **Simple Sync — bidirectional multi-device sync** — the "Sync everything between your devices" toggle (Settings → Cloud Sync) is now fully wired. Enabling it publishes connections, groups, templates, snippets, and non-secret variables to `full-sync.rcn` in the configured sync directory; on startup and after local changes the app merges remote changes by UUID (`updated_at` wins) and applies creates, updates, and deletions. Groups carry their own modification timestamp, so renames, icon/inheritance edits, and re-parenting propagate (not just create/delete); device-specific group fields (SSH key path, jump-host, agent socket, UI/order state) and Group-Sync bookkeeping are stripped from the shared file and preserved per device on import. Deletions propagate via tombstones (default 30-day retention), and tombstones from other devices are carried forward so a deletion reaches a third device through the shared file. Notes: passwords are never written to the sync file (they stay in your per-device keyring); non-secret variables are merged additively by name (a new variable on one device appears on the others — secret variables, variable edits, and variable deletions do not propagate, since variables have no per-item timestamp); clusters are not synced yet (their model lacks the modification timestamp the merge needs); connections that start asynchronously after a port check are regrouped on the next sync rather than instantly
- **SSH config import follows `Include` directives** — the importer ignored OpenSSH `Include` lines, so hosts defined in included files (common in modern split configs) were missed. `Include` is now expanded — glob patterns supported, relative paths resolved against `~/.ssh`, recursion capped at OpenSSH's 16 levels — and each physical file is parsed only once (no duplicates when a `config.d` glob is both auto-enumerated and included)

### Changed

- **Tab groups persist in workspaces** — assigning a tab to a named group (e.g. "Production") was in-memory only and lost on restart. A workspace now stores each session's group and restores it when reopened. (Port-checked connections that start asynchronously are not regrouped on restore yet.)
- **Jump-host / SSH-args resolution deduplicated** (internal) — initial connect and in-place reconnect each carried ~150 near-identical lines building the identity file, jump-host `ProxyCommand`/`-J` chain (with Flatpak known_hosts and first-hop PKCS#11), and waypipe detection, so a fix to one path could silently miss the other. Both now call a single `build_ssh_command_args()`; reconnect also gains the waypipe-fallback logging it previously lacked
- **Dynamic-connection IDs are now stable across Rust versions** — IDs were derived from `std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher`, whose output is not guaranteed stable between toolchain releases, so a compiler upgrade could silently change every dynamic connection's UUID. They now use spec-defined UUID v5 (SHA-1, group as namespace, name+host+protocol as key). Upgrading to 0.17.2 regenerates dynamic-connection IDs once; they stay stable afterwards. Removed the now-unused `DynamicConnectionId` type

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: uuid 1.23.3→1.23.4, wasm-bindgen/js-sys/web-sys ecosystem (wasm-bindgen 0.2.125→0.2.126, js-sys 0.3.102→0.3.103, web-sys 0.3.102→0.3.103, wasm-bindgen-futures 0.4.75→0.4.76)

## [0.17.1] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **WinBox connection preset** ([#190](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/190)) — added a ready-made template (Remote Desktop category) for MikroTik's WinBox GUI: `WinBox ${host} ${user} ${password}`
- **Native PKCS#11 / YubiKey SSH authentication** ([#189](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/189)) — a new "PKCS#11 Provider" field in the SSH connection editor (Session group) lets you point at a hardware-token library (e.g. `/usr/lib64/libykcs11.so.2`); it maps to `-o PKCS11Provider=<path>`, so YubiKey/PIV/smart-card keys are offered without the SSH-agent workaround. The directive is also imported from `~/.ssh/config` (`PKCS11Provider`).
  - **Works through SSH tunnels** — because `-o PKCS11Provider` is *not* inherited by `ProxyJump` child connections, the provider of a jump-host connection is now injected explicitly into the first hop's `ProxyCommand` (terminal SSH and RDP/VNC/SPICE tunnels). Enable PKCS#11 on the bastion connection to authenticate the jump itself with the token.
  - PKCS#11 does not force `IdentitiesOnly`, so the token's keys are always offered. The PIN/touch prompt appears in the session terminal. Note: with a jump host the token may prompt once per hop (separate SSH processes).

### Fixed

- **Flatpak: GUI / non-`script` Generic commands now launch** ([#190](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/190)) — a Generic Zero Trust command failed with `Portal call failed: Failed to start command: "script"` whenever the host had no reachable `script` (util-linux) binary — atomic distros, or `script` outside the sandbox PATH the `flatpak-spawn` portal resolves against. GUI tools such as WinBox also do not need the PTY that `script` allocates. The host command is now run through a login shell (`sh -lc`, so the host PATH resolves binaries) that probes for `script` and falls back to a plain `sh -c` when it is absent

### Changed

- **Removed dead VNC FFI stub** (internal) — deleted `rustconn-core/src/ffi/` (`VncDisplay`, `FfiDisplay`, `ConnectionState`, `FfiError`). Despite documenting itself as a safe wrapper around the `gtk-vnc` C library, it had no `gtk-vnc` dependency, opened no connection (`open_host` only mutated in-memory state), and its signal callbacks were never invoked — so the `VncSessionWidget` "native" path it backed could never connect. Embedded VNC already runs through the native `vnc-rs` client (`EmbeddedVncWidget`) with an external-viewer fallback; the stub and its now-unreachable `VncSessionWidget` methods (`connect`, `provide_credentials`, `set_scaling`, `display`, `connect_auth_required`) were removed (YAGNI). Synced `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (dropped the stale `broadcast.rs` entry) and bumped the doc version headers.
- **Removed archived-spec traceability comments** (internal) — stripped dangling `// Requirement X.Y` / `# Requirements Coverage` doc-comment references (~225 lines across 30 source files) that pointed at specs now under `.kiro/specs/_archive/`. Descriptive text was preserved (the requirement prefix removed), pure traceability sections deleted.
- **Removed unused `performance` scaffolding** (internal) — deleted dead utilities from `rustconn-core` that had no production callers: object pool, compact string, batch processor, lazy init, shrinkable vec, virtual scroller, the performance-metrics timer, and the `MemoryOptimizer`/`MemoryTracker` machinery (~1900 LOC). The only live functionality — the connection string interner and the search debouncer — is retained; the global interner is now exposed directly as `performance::interner()`. Also synced `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (connection-dialog `dialog/` split, `builders.rs`/`web.rs`, `WebProtocol`, `performance/`, `tracing/`).

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: chacha20 0.10.0→0.10.1

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-23

A hardening release: targeted security, performance, and tech-debt fixes following a full codebase audit. No major new functionality.

### Security

- **kubectl / Zero Trust Generic command injection** — Kubernetes and Zero Trust Generic sessions now spawn their command argv directly instead of through `sh -c`, so shell metacharacters in (possibly imported, untrusted) configs can no longer be interpreted as commands
- **Legacy XOR credential format removed** — the obsolete XOR fallback for credentials without the `RCSC` header has been removed; it provided no real protection and its migration window (since v0.12) has long passed. Only AES-256-GCM credentials are read
- **Credential threat model documented** — `SECURITY.md` now explains the machine-key encryption model (obfuscation at rest, not protection against same-user read) and recommends keyring/vault backends for real secrets
- **Passbolt passphrase exposure documented** — added a Known Issue noting that `go-passbolt-cli` accepts the passphrase only as a command-line argument, with mitigations and upstream status
- **Transient secret hardening** — Bitwarden and KeePassXC serialized item buffers are now wrapped in `Zeroizing` so plaintext is wiped on drop

### Added

- **Workspace split layout restore** — opening a saved workspace now restores its split-pane layout, not just the connections

### Fixed

- **RDPDR dead notify computation** — removed an unused `FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION` computation on the directory-watch path (the builder is kept ready for when IronRDP exposes the response type)

### Improved

- **Terminal highlight rendering** — highlight colours are pre-parsed once at rule-compile time instead of on every repaint; match values are now `Copy` and allocation-free on the hot path, and column offsets are computed as a single-scan delta
- **Connection sorting** — group sort caches lowercase keys (`sort_by_cached_key`) instead of recomputing them on every comparison
- **Autotype dialog** — the embedded-RDP "type text" dialog is now an `adw::Dialog` (ToolbarView + HeaderBar) instead of a raw window, so it stays attached on Wayland
- **Touch targets** — header-bar icon buttons now meet the GNOME HIG 44×44px minimum tap target
- **Lint hygiene** — migrated `#[allow]` overrides to `#[expect]` (warns when a lint stops firing) and added the `clone_on_ref_ptr` restriction lint
- **IronRDP panic guard re-evaluated** — confirmed the `connect_finalize` catch_unwind wrapper is still needed (0.16 remains the latest release; upstream panic reports stay open) and refreshed the inline note

### Changed

- **Build** — narrowed the workspace `tokio` feature set from `full` to the exact features used, trimming compile time

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: rustls 0.23.40→0.23.41

## [0.16.13] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **RDP RTT (latency) display** — embedded IronRDP sessions now show round-trip time in the toolbar status label when the server reports network characteristics via Auto-Detect PDU (MS-RDPBCGR 2.2.14.1.5). The Echo virtual channel (MS-RDPEECO) is also registered, enabling the server to measure RTT via echo request/response probes

### Improved

- **Dynamic RDP resolution change now works in embedded mode** — the Display Control Virtual Channel (MS-RDPEDISP) is now registered on the dynamic-channel client alongside the new Echo channel. Previously it was never registered, so every window resize fell back to a full reconnect (the 0.16.3 "Fit resolution to window" feature always took the reconnect path). On servers that advertise Display Control capabilities, the desktop is now re-sized seamlessly without dropping the session

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: ironrdp 0.15→0.16 (ironrdp-session 0.9→0.10, ironrdp-dvc 0.6→0.7, ironrdp-displaycontrol 0.6→0.7, ironrdp-server 0.11→0.12, ironrdp-rdpsnd 0.8→0.8.1, ironrdp-echo 0.2→0.3)
- **Added**: ironrdp-echo 0.3 (Echo DVC for RTT measurement)
- **Updated**: quote 1.0.45→1.0.46, time 0.3.49→0.3.51, time-macros 0.2.29→0.2.30, zlib-rs 0.6.3→0.6.4

## [0.16.12] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Workspace profiles** — save currently open sessions as a named workspace and restore them all at once. Access via *Tools → Workspaces...* menu. Features:
  - Save current set of active connections (with tab order) under a custom name
  - Open a saved workspace to reconnect all its entries in one click
  - Rename workspace profiles inline from the manager dialog
  - Delete workspace profiles that are no longer needed
  - Workspace profiles persist across restarts (`~/.config/rustconn/workspace_profiles.toml`)
  - Workspace entries auto-clean when a referenced connection is deleted

- **Port knocking** — built-in pre-connect port knock sequence, no external `knock` CLI needed. Configured per-connection (`Connection.knock_sequence`):
  - TCP and UDP knocks with configurable inter-knock delay and post-knock settle time
  - Parse from human-readable format: `"7000 8000/tcp 9000/udp"`
  - Inline validation in the connection editor — invalid format highlighted immediately
  - Works inside Flatpak sandbox (pure Rust, no shell command)
  - Each knock logged via tracing for diagnostics

- **fwknop Single Packet Authorization (SPA)** — built-in fwknop-compatible packet builder (AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256, OpenSSL EVP_BytesToKey wire format). Sends an encrypted UDP packet to open firewall rules before connecting. Integrated into the pre-connect chain (knock → SPA → port check → connect). No external `fwknop` CLI needed — pure Rust implementation using existing `aes`/`cbc`/`ring` crates. Full GUI in the Advanced tab of the connection editor: Rijndael key, HMAC key (password entries with peek), access spec, destination port, and allow-IP mode (Source IP / Resolve Public / Explicit). Configure per-connection via `spa_config`

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: log 0.4.32→0.4.33
- **Added** (direct, previously transitive): aes 0.9, cbc 0.2, md-5 0.11 — for fwknop SPA packet builder

## [0.16.11] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Connection wizard's "Zero Trust" card showed only a custom-command field instead of the provider list** — the wizard reuses a single connection page, and selecting the "Custom Command" card runs a mode that hides the Zero Trust provider dropdown and retitles the group; `configure_for_protocol(ZeroTrust)` never restored them, so the "Zero Trust" card degraded to a bare command field. On top of that the dropdown defaulted to "Custom Command" (index 0), so even a fresh selection opened on a command field. The "Zero Trust" card now always restores the full provider picker (AWS SSM, GCP IAP, Azure Bastion/SSH, Cloudflare Access, Teleport, Tailscale SSH, Boundary, Hoop.dev) and defaults to AWS Session Manager, mirroring the Advanced editor; the "Custom Command" card still resets to the Generic command mode
- **RDP Mouse Jiggler never actually ran in embedded (IronRDP) mode** ([#185](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/185)) — the 0.16.10 keep-alive fix added the Scroll Lock keystroke, but the jiggler timer was only ever armed from `set_state`, and the embedded connection paths set the `Connected` state directly (via the event callback) without routing through `set_state`. As a result the timer was never started in embedded mode, so neither the mouse-move nor the Scroll Lock keep-alive was sent — the very mode the feature is documented to support. The jiggler is now armed (and stopped on disconnect/error) directly from the embedded `Connected`/`Disconnected`/`Error` event handlers, via a shared `JigglerHandles` struct also used by `set_state`
- **External RDP (sdl-freerdp) ignored its `sdl-freerdp.json` configuration in the Flatpak build** ([#183](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/183)) — the bundled FreeRDP was compiled with no JSON backend (the GNOME runtime ships neither cJSON, json-c, nor jansson), so WinPR fell back to `json-stub.c` and `WINPR_JSON_ParseFromFile()` always returned null. As a result the SDL client silently discarded `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/freerdp/sdl-freerdp.json`, and the built-in SDL hotkeys (Right Shift + D disconnect, etc.) could not be disabled or remapped no matter where the config file was placed. A static **cJSON** module is now built ahead of FreeRDP in all Flatpak manifests, enabling `WITH_WINPR_JSON=ON`, so user prefs such as `{ "SDL_KeyModMask": ["KMOD_NONE"] }` take effect

- **RDP connections created through the New Connection wizard never stored the password** ([#188](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/188)) — typing a password on the wizard's authentication step and pressing *Save & Connect* (without opening *Advanced…*) silently dropped the secret: `build_connection()` collected `partial.password` but never set `password_source` or persisted the value, so the connection was created with `PasswordSource::None`. The result was an immediate "NLA authentication failed" with no usable credential, fixable only by manually editing the connection and changing Password Source. The wizard now marks a typed password as `Vault` (skipping key/agent/security-key auth) and persists it through `save_password_to_vault`, mirroring the full editor. The *Advanced…* hand-off also carries the typed password into the full dialog instead of discarding it
- **RDP through an RD Gateway rendered a broken/black session in embedded mode** ([#187](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/187)) — when a connection used an RD Gateway, IronRDP correctly bailed out (it has no MS-TSGU support), but `connect()` then fell through to embedded `wlfreerdp`. The embedded launch path (`thread.rs`) never emits the `/g:` / `/gu:` gateway arguments, so it connected straight to the gateway host on port 3389 with no tunnelling. The gateway answers on the socket — hence the immediate "FreeRDP connected" — but no real RDP session is established, leaving a black screen. Gateway connections now skip embedded `wlfreerdp` and go directly to the external client (`launcher::add_connection_args`), which wires up gateway routing correctly, mirroring the existing skip for RemoteApp

### Changed

- **Advanced connection editor has a distinct window title** — the full multi-tab editor (opened via *New Connection (Advanced)…*, Shift+Ctrl+N, or the wizard's *Advanced…* button) was titled "New Connection", identical to the simplified protocol-picker wizard, making the two indistinguishable. It is now titled "New Connection (Advanced)" through every entry point — including the wizard's *Advanced…* hand-off, which previously reset the title back to "New Connection"; edit mode still overrides this with "Edit Connection"

### Internal

- **Connection wizard no longer distinguishes the "Custom Command" card by its display string** — the protocol grid's *Custom Command* and *Zero Trust* cards both map to `ProtocolType::ZeroTrust`, and the custom-command mode was selected via `label == "Custom Command"`. That comparison would silently break the moment the label were wrapped in `i18n()`. Replaced with an explicit `is_custom_command` field on `ProtocolDef`

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: arrayvec 0.7.6→0.7.7
- **cJSON (Flatpak)** 1.7.18→1.7.19 — bundled JSON backend for FreeRDP/WinPR updated to the latest upstream release


## [0.16.10] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **RDP Mouse Jiggler did not prevent the remote desktop from locking** ([#185](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/185)) — in Embedded (IronRDP) mode the jiggler sent only a tiny mouse-move every interval. That is enough to keep the RDP *session* from idle-disconnecting, but Windows does **not** refresh its workstation lock / screensaver timer (`GetLastInputInfo`) on RDP-injected pointer motion alone, so unattended desktops still locked after the configured inactivity limit (e.g. 10 minutes) regardless of a 10-second jiggle interval. Each jiggle tick now also taps **Scroll Lock twice** (toggle on, then off) — a layout-independent keyboard event that reliably resets the lock timer, produces no character, triggers no action, and leaves the Scroll Lock state unchanged. The mouse-move is kept for session-level keep-alive

### Known limitations

- **Mouse Jiggler only works in Embedded (IronRDP) mode** — the External RDP client runs as a separate FreeRDP process with no input channel back to RustConn, so neither the mouse-move nor the keyboard keep-alive can be injected into it. The setting is silently inactive in External mode; use Embedded mode if you need the jiggler. (Earlier docs incorrectly claimed external-mode support)

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: cc 1.2.64→1.2.65
- **FreeRDP (Flatpak)** 3.27.0→3.27.1 — bundled RDP backend updated to the latest upstream maintenance release

## [0.16.9] - 2026-06-19

### Removed

- **Dead ad-hoc broadcast controller** — the `BroadcastController` (`rustconn/src/broadcast.rs`) and its `TerminalNotebook` wrappers (`toggle_broadcast`, `is_broadcast_active`, `toggle_broadcast_terminal`, `is_broadcast_terminal_selected`, `broadcast_text`, `broadcast_controller`) implemented an ad-hoc "send keystrokes to several selected terminals" mode that was never wired to any action, menu, or shortcut. It was superseded by the split-view Broadcast toggle in the header bar (`win.toggle-broadcast`). The fields carried false `#[allow(dead_code, reason = "Public API — wired by app layer")]` annotations; the app layer never wired them. Deleted in full (YAGNI)
- **Unused virtual-scroll tuning API** — `VirtualScrollConfig` (`rustconn-core/src/connection/virtual_scroll.rs`) was exercised only by its own unit tests and never wired into the sidebar. Removed; the still-used `SelectionState` from the same module is kept
- **Unused protocol-layout builder setters** — `ProtocolLayoutBuilder::{max_size, tightening_threshold, spacing, margin}` were never called outside tests (all protocol panels use `new().build()` with defaults). Removed along with the module-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]`

### Changed

- **Removed stale `dead_code` overrides** — dropped the module-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]` from `dialogs/connection/ssh.rs`; all its functions (`create_ssh_options`, `create_port_forwarding_group`, `add_port_forward_row_to_list`) are in active use, so the override was masking nothing

### Documentation

- **Corrected stale doc comments** — `cmd_connect`'s `build_connection_command` no longer claims special `ZeroTrust` handling (it now goes through `ProtocolRegistry` like every other protocol; only `Sftp` is special-cased), and `GroupSyncExport::from_group_tree` no longer references unfinished "tasks 2.9–2.11" (the constructor is implemented and used by `SyncManager`)

### Fixed

- **RDP Quick Actions / Shell launchers typed wrong characters on non-QWERTY remote layouts** ([#184](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/184)) — the Run-dialog commands (Computer Management, Device Manager, Disk Management, Event Viewer, Registry Editor, Resource Monitor, Server Manager, Services) and the PowerShell/CMD shell launchers were typed character-by-character using hard-coded **US-QWERTY scancodes**. On a remote Windows session with a different keyboard layout (e.g. French AZERTY) the same physical scancodes produced different characters, so `compmgmt.msc` arrived as `co,p,g,t:,sc`. The command text is now sent via Unicode keyboard events (`TS_UNICODE_KEYBOARD_EVENT`, the same layout-independent autotype path already used for snippets), while only the layout-safe Win+R and Enter keys remain scancodes. Removes the entire `char_to_scancode` US-layout table

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: bitvec 1.0.1→1.1.1


## [0.16.8] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **KeePassXC not detected in Flatpak ("keepassxc-cli not found")** ([#182](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/182)) — KeePassXC detection and all KDBX operations only searched the *sandbox* `PATH` (`which keepassxc-cli` plus host paths like `/usr/bin/keepassxc-cli`), which never resolve inside Flatpak, so the host's KeePassXC was never found even though the documentation promised automatic detection via `flatpak-spawn --host`. Unlike the bundled CLI tools (`bw`, `op`, `kubectl`), KeePassXC is the user's host GUI app and cannot be shipped as a Flatpak Component. Detection now resolves the host binary via `flatpak-spawn --host sh -lc 'command -v keepassxc-cli'`, and every `keepassxc-cli` invocation (show/add/ls/rm/verify/version) is routed through `flatpak-spawn --host` (which forwards stdin/stdout/stderr to the host process by default, so piped database/entry passwords reach it). Requires the host-shell permission (`--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak`, already in the manifest) and filesystem access to the `.kdbx` file
- **KDBX status text overflowed the row** ([#182](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/182)) — long status strings (e.g. "Invalid database password or key file") spilled past the "Connection Status" row next to the Check button. The status label now ellipsizes at a capped width and exposes the full text as a tooltip on hover
- **Settings → Interface: theme segmented control did not reflect the saved scheme** (libadwaita ≥ 1.7 builds) — on Flatpak/Fedora packages built with the `adw-1-7`/`adw-1-8` feature, the `AdwToggleGroup` for the color scheme was added to its row but the value returned to the loader was an empty placeholder box, so `load_ui_settings` had nothing to sync. Reopening Settings always showed "System" highlighted even when Dark or Light was saved and applied (the theme itself was correct — only the segmented control was out of step). The toggle group is now held inside its wrapper box (the same reparent-safe pattern used by the cursor shape/blink toggles) and the loader sets the active segment from the saved scheme

### Documentation

- **External FreeRDP keyboard shortcuts (Right Shift hotkeys)** ([#183](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/183)) — the User Guide now documents the built-in shortcuts of the FreeRDP SDL client used in External RDP mode (Right Shift + Enter/R/G/D/M for fullscreen/resize/grab/disconnect/minimize), why `Right Shift + D` drops the session, and that the "release input" key is `Right Shift + G` (not Win+Esc). It explains where to put `sdl-freerdp.json` for the Flatpak build — `~/.var/app/io.github.totoshko88.RustConn/config/freerdp/sdl-freerdp.json` (the bundled FreeRDP runs inside RustConn's own sandbox, so the `com.freerdp.FreeRDP` path and the host `/etc/FreeRDP/` do not apply), and gives ready-to-use JSON to either disable all hotkeys (`"SDL_KeyModMask": ["KMOD_NONE"]`) or remap only the disconnect key while keeping the grab toggle

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: ironrdp-graphics 0.8.0→0.8.1, ironrdp-rdpsnd 0.8.0→0.8.1, bytes 1.11.1→1.12.0, crypto-bigint 0.7.3→0.7.4, getrandom 0.4.2→0.4.3, syn 2.0.117→2.0.118

## [0.16.7] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Sidebar context menu rows invisible under KDE / Breeze GTK theme** ([#181](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/181)) — the connection/group right-click menu is a custom `Popover` of flat buttons whose text colour was inherited from the active GTK theme. Under a third-party theme (notably Breeze-GTK on KDE Plasma) the flat-button text was painted in a colour that clashed with the libadwaita popover background, so the rows rendered as white-on-white and the menu looked empty. The menu now pins its background and item text to the libadwaita popover palette (`@popover_bg_color` / `@popover_fg_color`) at application stylesheet priority, so the rows stay legible regardless of the system GTK theme, and forces normal font weight in case the theme bolds menu items
- **Smart-folder right-click menus had the same invisible-rows defect** — the context menus for a smart folder (Edit / Delete) and for a connection shown inside a smart folder (Connect, Edit, Copy Username/Password, Wake On LAN, Check if Online, Delete) are built from the same custom flat-button popover pattern and were also unreadable under Breeze-GTK on KDE. They now reuse the same popover palette styling; the destructive "Delete" entry keeps its red accent

### Dependencies (Flatpak)

- **FreeRDP** 3.26.0 → 3.27.0 — bundled RDP backend updated to the latest upstream maintenance release
- **fast_float** 8.0.2 → 8.2.10 — bundled FreeRDP build dependency updated within the 8.x series

## [0.16.6] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **Activity Monitor did nothing on most connections; per-tab toggle was stuck on Off** ([#180](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/180)) — activity/silence monitoring was only wired on one connection path (`start_connection_with_split`) and only for synchronous connects. Connecting via the sidebar's "Connect" action, the command palette, or a cluster never set it up at all, and even the split path missed the common asynchronous port-check route (where the session is created later in a background callback). On top of that, a session whose effective mode was `Off` was never registered with the coordinator, so right-clicking the tab and clicking "Monitor: Off" did nothing — the menu could not turn monitoring on. Activity monitoring is now wired from a single choke point (the notebook's session-creation hook), so it works for every terminal protocol (SSH, Telnet, serial, Kubernetes, Mosh, Zero Trust), every connect entry point, and both synchronous and port-checked connections. Sessions are always registered (even when Off) so the per-tab "Monitor" menu can cycle Off → Activity → Silence on a live session without reconnecting. In-place reconnect re-arms monitoring as well
- **Silence notification could report the wrong connection name** — the coordinator's silence callback captured a single connection's name when it was wired, so with several monitored tabs open every silence toast/notification showed the most recently wired name. The name is now resolved per session when the notification fires

### Notes

- Changing a connection's Activity Monitor mode in its settings still applies to *new* sessions; for an already-open tab, use the right-click tab menu to change the mode live, or reconnect

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: h2 0.4.14→0.4.15

## [0.16.5] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Keyboard shortcuts did nothing under non-Latin keyboard layouts** — accelerators are registered with Latin keyvals (`<Control>n`), but GTK matches them against the keyval produced by the *active* layout, so under a Cyrillic/Greek/etc. layout pressing Ctrl+N yielded `Cyrillic_en` and the shortcut silently did nothing (the in-app recorder already normalized to Latin, but runtime matching did not). A capture-phase key controller now maps the hardware keycode back to its Latin keyval and activates the matching action when it is currently bound. User overrides and keyboard-passthrough mode are honored automatically (it queries the live accelerators), and Latin layouts are untouched
- **RDP external client closed immediately with no explanation** ([#177](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/177) follow-up) — when the embedded IronRDP first-frame watchdog (0.16.3) fell back to the external FreeRDP client — or when external mode was selected directly — the client's `stderr` was redirected to `/dev/null`, so a failed connection (authentication failure, rejected certificate, unsupported codec, wrong display backend) just made a window flash and close with no diagnostic anywhere. On top of that the widget was left in a phantom `Connected` state because the spawned process was never checked for an early exit. FreeRDP's `stderr` is now captured and forwarded to the application log, and a short startup watchdog (polls for ~3 s) detects an immediate exit and surfaces it as a clear, localized error instead of a silent blank tab
- **macOS: wrong default secret backend on a fresh install** — `SecretSettings` defaulted to `libsecret` on every platform, but libsecret does not exist on macOS, so a new install fell back through an unavailable backend instead of using the system Keychain. The default is now platform-aware (`MacOsKeychain` on macOS, `libsecret` elsewhere), and the Settings → Secrets backend selector shows and persists "macOS Keychain" for the system-keyring slot on macOS instead of the meaningless "libsecret" label
- **macOS: misleading "not installed" error for any terminal spawn failure** — the native-PTY launcher reported every failure (PTY allocation, fd duplication, controlling-terminal setup) as `Command not found` / `'…' is not installed`. Only a genuine missing-executable error (NotFound) now uses that wording; other failures surface the actual error text in the toast so the cause is diagnosable
- **macOS: `gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` workaround fought the system theme** — the Linux/KDE/XFCE xsettings workaround that force-clears this property also ran on macOS, where the property mirrors the system `NSAppearance`. Clearing it interfered with "Follow system" dark mode and produced repeated misleading log lines. The workaround is now gated to non-macOS platforms

### Improved

- **RDP connection diagnostics** — the external FreeRDP launcher now logs the selected binary (`wlfreerdp3`/`sdl-freerdp3`/`xfreerdp3`), the session type (Wayland vs X11), and the full argument vector (the password is never on the command line, so this is safe) at debug level. The embedded IronRDP path now logs how long the first displayable frame took to arrive, making it possible to tell a genuine GFX/H.264-only server (no frame at all) apart from a slow first paint on a high-latency link. Run with `RUST_LOG=debug` to collect this when reporting RDP issues
- **Quieter logs: CSS theme-parser warning flood suppressed** — GTK4's CSS parser emits hundreds of harmless `Theme parser warning … Expected ';'` lines while reading the libadwaita ≥1.9 stylesheet (most visible on macOS/Homebrew). A GLib log writer now drops only those specific messages and forwards every other GTK/GLib message unchanged, so real warnings are no longer buried
- **macOS Keychain: secret bytes zeroized on decode failure** — if a stored Keychain value failed UTF-8 decoding, the raw bytes (potentially password material) were dropped without being wiped; they are now zeroized before the error is returned
- **macOS: native key symbols on the welcome screen** — the welcome screen's Keyboard Shortcuts column now renders combos with macOS symbols (`⌃ ⇧ ⌥ ⌫`, e.g. `⌃⇧T`) instead of the `Ctrl+Shift+T` text. The bindings themselves are unchanged (RustConn still uses Control on macOS, shown as `⌃`); this is presentation only. The Shortcuts dialog already renders natively via `AdwShortcutsItem`

### Translations

- **Italian** — updated translations contributed by [@albanobattistella](https://github.com/albanobattistella) ([#179](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/pull/179))
- New string for the external-client early-exit error, translated across all 16 languages
- New strings for the macOS terminal spawn-failure messages (`Failed to start '{}'`, `Failed to start '{}': {}`)

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: yuv 0.8.15→0.8.16

## [0.16.4] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **MobaXterm import/export lost nested folder structure** ([#178](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/178)) — `.mxtsessions` `SubRep` paths such as `Production\Web` were imported as a single flat group literally named `Production\Web` instead of a `Production` → `Web` tree, and export only emitted sections for folders that held direct sessions while building deeper paths in an order-dependent, sometimes-incorrect way. Import now splits each `SubRep` on the backslash separator and rebuilds the full folder tree (creating and reusing intermediate groups with correct `parent_id`), and export walks the parent chain to produce full paths, emits one section per group sorted so parents precede children, and includes intermediate folders even when they contain no direct sessions — so the hierarchy round-trips correctly between RustConn and MobaXterm
- **SecureCRT export mangled folders nested 3+ levels deep** — the directory-path builder updated paths in a single order-dependent pass, so a connection in `A/B/C` could be written to a truncated path like `B/C` when groups were processed child-first. Paths are now built by walking the parent chain (correct at any depth), and a directory is created for every group so empty intermediate folders are preserved
- **Asbru-CM export dropped parent links on deep hierarchies** — the group-to-UUID map was filled incrementally while emitting entries, so a child group serialized before its parent lost its `parent:` reference. The full map is now built up front, so nesting survives regardless of group order

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: time 0.3.47→0.3.49, time-core 0.1.8→0.1.9, time-macros 0.2.27→0.2.29

## [0.16.3] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- **RDP "Fit resolution to window" toolbar button** — a new left-aligned button (monitor icon) in the embedded RDP toolbar re-requests the session resolution to match the current window size, the same effect as resizing the window. This covers the edge case where the window was resized between connection start and the session becoming active (so the desktop did not fill the whole window) on servers without dynamic resolution. Uses the Display Control Channel (MS-RDPEDISP) for a seamless change when available, otherwise reconnects
- **Error details in Connection History** — failed connection entries now show an info button that opens a dialog with the captured error message. The connection toast is transient and disappears quickly; the stored error can now be re-read later for debugging. For embedded RDP sessions the specific, user-friendly error (auth failure, TLS, timeout, …) is persisted instead of a generic placeholder

### Fixed

- **Failed connections were missing from the history** — when a pre-connection port check timed out (host unreachable), the attempt only updated the sidebar status and showed a toast; no history entry was ever created, so the failure was lost. Failed port checks are now recorded in connection history with the reachability error, across all protocols (SSH, RDP, VNC, SPICE, Telnet, MOSH, SFTP)
- **RDP connects but the desktop never appears** ([#177](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/177)) — servers that only offer the GFX graphics pipeline with H.264/AVC444 (which the embedded IronRDP client cannot decode yet) completed the handshake successfully but never produced a displayable frame, leaving a blank session. A first-frame watchdog now detects this (connected but no frame within 8 s) and automatically falls back to the external FreeRDP client, which supports those codecs

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: openssl 0.10.80→0.10.81, openssl-sys 0.9.116→0.9.117, zeroize 1.8.2→1.9.0, zeroize_derive 1.4.3→1.5.0, js-sys 0.3.100→0.3.102, web-sys 0.3.100→0.3.102, wasm-bindgen 0.2.123→0.2.125 (and related macro/futures crates), wasip2 1.0.3→1.0.4


## [0.16.2] - 2026-06-13

### Improved

- **GNOME HIG follow-up audit**:
  - critical errors are no longer transient toasts: vault password save failure, secret load failure in the variables dialog, and smart folder deletion failure now show a blocking alert dialog (a toast could disappear before the user notices a lost credential)
  - error alert dialogs no longer style the OK button as destructive (red is reserved for irreversible actions)
  - sidebar drag-and-drop indicators use the libadwaita accent color (`@accent_bg_color`) instead of a hardcoded orange, following the user's accent color and high-contrast mode
- **Dead code cleanup**: removed the unused `ContainerState` machine and `is_split`/`is_welcome` from `TabPageContainer` (leftovers of an abandoned "Phase 2" refactoring), the never-called `load_variable_from_vault` wrapper, and stale `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes that compiler verification (`#[expect]`) proved unnecessary

### Fixed

- **F10 still opened the application menu in keyboard passthrough mode** — the F10 primary-menu binding is GTK-internal (driven by the header-bar menu button's `primary` property), not an application accelerator, so disabling shortcuts via Ctrl+Shift+Backspace did not affect it. The `primary` flag is now dropped while passthrough is active, so F10 reaches the remote session (e.g. Midnight Commander) and is restored when passthrough is turned off
- **Ctrl+T (SSH Tunnel Manager) ignored keyboard passthrough and was not customizable** — the accelerator was registered directly instead of through the central keybinding registry; it is now a regular keybinding (visible in Settings → Keybindings, disabled in passthrough mode like all others)

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: block-buffer 0.12.0→0.12.1, cc 1.2.63→1.2.64, memchr 2.8.1→2.8.2, smallvec 1.15.1→1.15.2, yuv 0.8.14→0.8.15

## [0.16.1] - 2026-06-12

### Improved

- **Settings dialog GNOME HIG pass** — fixes from a HIG audit of the preferences dialog:
  - secret fields (Bitwarden master password / client secret, 1Password token, Passbolt passphrase, KeePass database password) migrated from `GtkPasswordEntry`-in-a-row to `adw::PasswordEntryRow` (built-in peek icon, caps-lock warning, focus on row click)
  - highlight-rules editor rebuilt: one expandable row per rule with proper `EntryRow`s, enable switch and delete button — replaces the raw entry grid inside a nested scrolled area (scrolling-inside-scrolling anti-pattern); rule name/pattern are reflected live in the row title/subtitle
  - rows with suffix controls (language, startup action, keybinding rows, SSH key rows, cloud-sync import) are now activatable via the row itself — keyboard and touch users no longer have to hit the small suffix widget; "Add SSH Key" row previously did nothing when clicked
  - "Reset All to Defaults" for keyboard shortcuts now asks for confirmation before wiping every customized shortcut
  - "Restart to apply" after a settings restore is a dialog with a "Quit now" option instead of a transient toast (persistent state must not auto-dismiss)
  - backup/restore failures caused by an inaccessible configuration directory are now shown to the user instead of only being logged
  - removed extra `suggested-action` styling from inline Add/Import buttons (one suggested action per dialog); error dialog headings unified to sentence case ("Backup failed", "Restore failed"); the "ZIP archives" file-filter name is now translatable

### Fixed

- **Settings dialog took 5+ seconds to appear with Bitwarden backend (flatpak)** — the Secrets tab's keyring auto-unlock chain (`bw status` / `bw unlock` / `bw sync`, each a 1–3 s Node.js cold start in the sandbox) was scheduled with `glib::spawn_future`, which runs on the GTK **main context**, not a worker thread — the dialog was mapped but its first frame waited until the whole chain finished. All blocking secret-CLI and keyring calls in the settings dialog (and the SSH-agent probe in the connection dialog) now run via `gio::spawn_blocking` on a real worker thread; measured first-frame time in flatpak dropped from ~5.3 s to the normal ~150 ms
- **UI froze for seconds right after startup with Bitwarden backend (flatpak)** — `resolve_bw_cmd()` probes CLI candidates by running `bw --version`, a Node.js cold start that takes 1–3 s inside the flatpak sandbox, and it ran on the GTK main thread during the startup idle handler. Clicking anything (e.g. opening Settings) during that window appeared to hang. The probe now runs on the background auto-unlock thread; the result is cached process-wide as before

- **Sidebar context menu dismissed on deeply nested rows (KDE Plasma)** ([#157](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/157)) — follow-up to the 0.16.0 fix: on rows at nesting level 3+ the menu opened via the ListView-level fallback and was cancelled by KWin ~45 ms later; the deferred `autohide=true` retry could not re-acquire a grab because its input serial was stale. Fallback- and keyboard-invoked menus now take the grab immediately (within the triggering event), and pointer-invoked menus no longer move keyboard focus into the menu (which itself triggered the compositor dismissal)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Batch edit for multi-selected connections** — group-operations mode (multi-selection) gains a "Batch Edit" action in the bulk toolbar: change group, tags, or icon for all selected connections in one pass. Each field has an "apply" check so only the chosen fields are written; the result toast offers Undo that restores the previous values
- **Notes badge in the sidebar** — connections with a description now show a small `document-edit-symbolic` badge next to their name (with the note text in the tooltip and a screen-reader label), so it is visible at a glance which entries have documentation without opening each one. Inspired by recurring requests in competing tools
- **Search matches connection notes** — sidebar search and smart search now score the connection description (weight below name/host/tags), so "the server where we replaced the certificate" can be found by the words in its notes
- **Windows (WSL2) guide** ([#137](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/137)) — new [docs/WSL.md](docs/WSL.md) with a step-by-step setup for running RustConn on Windows via WSLg: WSL install/update, enabling systemd for D-Bus/Secret Service (the most common pitfall), OBS/.deb install, secret-storage options, known WSLg limitations (no tray, audio latency, usbipd for serial) and troubleshooting. Linked from README and INSTALL

### Changed

- **Structured validation errors in core** — `dialog_utils` validators (`validate_name`, `validate_host`, `validate_port`, `validate_icon`) now return a `ValidationError` enum (`thiserror`) instead of plain strings, so callers can pattern-match variants; user-facing messages are unchanged and still localized at the GUI call sites
- **RDP `catch_unwind` wrapper kept for 0.16** — re-evaluated per the in-code TODO: ironrdp is still at 0.15.0 and upstream has not confirmed that panics on malformed PDUs are gone, so the panic guard around `connect_finalize` stays (re-check on the next ironrdp bump)

### Fixed

- **Sidebar context menu failing to open on KDE Plasma** ([#157](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/157)) — two fixes based on the reporter's `RUST_LOG=debug` output: (1) the popover's `closed` handler unparented the widget synchronously inside GTK's popdown sequence, which could free the popover mid-emission and produce `gtk_popover_get_autohide: assertion 'GTK_IS_POPOVER' failed`; the unparent is now deferred to idle. (2) KWin cancels non-grabbing popups (our menus use `autohide=false` per #87), so the menu could be dismissed by the compositor immediately after opening; if that happens within 300 ms with no user interaction, the menu now re-opens once with `autohide=true` (grab taken — KWin keeps it)

### Internal

- **`dialogs/connection/dialog.rs` split into submodules** — the largest file in the project (5988 lines) is now a `dialog/` module with focused submodules (`build`, `construction`, `save`, `rows`, `populate`, `passwords`, `agent_variables`); pure code motion, no behavior changes
- **New tests for security-sensitive core modules** — property tests verify `shell_escape` output round-trips byte-for-byte through a real POSIX `sh` (drag-and-drop paths are an injection surface), and `smart_folder` rule matching gained unit tests for case-insensitive host patterns and multi-criteria AND logic

### Security

- **Password handling in RDP/SPICE clients documented and regression-tested** — the plain-`String` password copies required by the third-party ironrdp/spice-client APIs are now explicitly documented as an upstream API limitation, and new tests assert that `RdpClientConfig`/`SpiceClientConfig` Debug output never leaks the plaintext password

## [0.15.14] - 2026-06-11

### Improved

- **External RDP/VNC sessions no longer freeze the window for 1.5 s on connect** — launching FreeRDP blocked the GTK main thread with a `sleep(1500ms)` used to catch immediate failures (certificate/auth errors). The launcher now returns right after spawn and watches the process with a non-blocking 250 ms poll over the same 1.5 s window; early failures still close the tab, show the parsed FreeRDP error toast, and record the failure in history
- **Tray messages are now event-driven instead of polled** — the main loop woke ~20×/second to `try_recv()` tray clicks even when idle, costing CPU and battery on laptops. Tray menu events (Linux ksni, macOS) now arrive over an `async-channel` awaited on the main context, so the loop only wakes on real clicks; tray handling is skipped entirely when the tray icon is disabled in settings
- **Secret backend detection in Settings is parallel and cached** — probing KeePassXC, Bitwarden, 1Password, Passbolt, pass and secret-tool spawned 10+ CLI processes sequentially (1–5 s before statuses appeared). Probes now run in parallel scoped threads (latency = slowest probe) and the result is cached for 30 s, making a quick reopen of Settings instant; the result-delivery loop also no longer spins the main loop at 100% CPU while detection runs (idle source → 50 ms timer)
- **Connection history writes are debounced and off the main thread** — every session start/end serialized and wrote `history.toml` inline on the GTK main thread (twice per session). Changes now mark history dirty and a flusher coalesces a 2 s burst into a single write on a background thread; pending changes are flushed on shutdown
- **One suggested action per dialog (GNOME HIG)** — "Add Variable"/"Add Property" in the connection dialog's Data tab no longer compete with the dialog's primary action for the suggested style, and the tunnel wizard hides its "Next" footer button while the empty-state "New SSH Connection" call-to-action is shown

### Dependencies

- **Added**: async-channel 2.5.0 (event-driven tray message delivery)
- **Updated**: crypto-primes 0.7.1→0.7.2

## [0.15.13] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Menu key / Shift+F10 opens the sidebar context menu for the selected row** ([#157](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/157)) — standard GNOME HIG keyboard access to the connection/group context menu, anchored to the selected row. Requested as a reliable alternative on systems where right-click on nested rows misbehaves
- **Confirmation before closing with open sessions** — closing the window or pressing Ctrl+Q with open session tabs now asks "Close RustConn?" with the number of open tabs instead of silently disconnecting everything. Skipped when minimize-to-tray is enabled (the app keeps running). Both the window close button and the `app.quit` action (which bypasses `close_request`) share the same dialog
- **Recording indicator in the sidebar** — a red `media-record-symbolic` dot (with tooltip and screen-reader label) appears next to a connection while any of its sessions is being recorded; recording is privacy-sensitive and must be visible at a glance. Driven by a new `on_recording_changed` notebook callback so every start/stop path (manual action, auto-record, session end) updates it
- **Import duplicate handling** — importing connections whose names already exist now shows a dialog with the duplicate count and the choices Cancel / Skip Duplicates / Import All, instead of silently creating renamed copies
- **Persistent cloud-sync failure banner** — sync errors (manual Sync Now and background auto-export, which previously only logged to the journal) now reveal an `adw::Banner` below the header bar that stays until dismissed or the next successful sync; transient toasts are kept for success messages only (GNOME HIG: banner for state that needs attention)
- **Touch long-press opens the sidebar context menu** — `GestureLongPress` (touch-only) on the connection list, sharing the coordinate-based row resolution with the right-click fallback

### Improved

- **Context menu keyboard navigation and accessibility** — the custom sidebar context menu now supports Up/Down arrow navigation with wrap-around plus Home/End, focuses its first item on open (so the Menu-key path is immediately navigable), highlights the focused item, and announces itself as a menu (`AccessibleRole::Menu` / `MenuItem`) to screen readers
- **Error message quality (GNOME HIG writing style)** — removed "Please" from 10 validation messages (imperative voice), replaced three generic "OK" buttons with "Close", and rewrote raw error surfaces ("Error: {e}", "Unknown error", "Error loading log file") to explain what happened and what to do next; export/log-file failures now name the likely cause (permissions, disk space, moved/deleted file)
- **Sidebar bottom-toolbar buttons enlarged to the 44×44 px minimum tap target** (GNOME HIG pointer & touch); Ukrainian translations added for all new strings

### Packaging & CI

- **Snap: `rustconn-cli` granted `password-manager-service`** — the CLI could not reach the system keyring (`rustconn-cli secret` failed under strict confinement) while the GUI app could; plugs are now in sync
- **Snap: SSH agent limitation documented honestly** — snapd has no interface exposing the host SSH agent socket (unlike Flatpak's `--socket=ssh-auth`), so agent-based auth cannot work in the snap; docs/SNAP.md previously suggested checking `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, now it documents the limitation, workarounds, and a comparison-table row
- **AppImage recipe migrated from jammy to noble** — `packaging/obs/AppImageBuilder.yml` still targeted Ubuntu 22.04, which never shipped the GTK4 build of VTE, while the released AppImage is already built on ubuntu-24.04 runners; the recipe now matches reality (incl. `*t64` package renames); test images that cannot run a noble-based AppImage (fedora-30, ubuntu-focal) removed
- **Supply-chain hygiene for CI downloads** — `flatpak-cargo-generator.py` (3 workflows) and `linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk.sh` are now fetched from pinned commits and verified against SHA-256 checksums; `linuxdeploy` (continuous tag, unstable checksums) gets retry + ELF sanity check; the Homebrew source tarball download gets retry with backoff plus a `tar -tzf` integrity check
- **CI cargo caches can seed each other** — all six cache blocks now share a `restore-keys` fallback, so check/clippy/test/proptest/MSRV jobs reuse each other's registry and target artifacts instead of rebuilding from scratch on every key miss
- **OBS spec hardening** — Fedora/RHEL `cargo build` now passes `--offline` (belt-and-suspenders on top of vendored sources) and the installed desktop file is checked with `desktop-file-validate` (`desktop-file-utils` added to BuildRequires)
- **OBS debian packaging** — `Recommends` now lists `freerdp3-x11 | freerdp3-wayland` alternatives (matching the top-level debian/), and a header comment documents the intentional differences between the two debian packagings
- **`AppImageBuilder.yml` version is now synced by workflows** — both `obs-update.yml` and the release OBS job update its version field alongside spec/dsc/_service (previously only the local hook did)
- **Flatpak manifests de-drifted** — release and local manifests updated to inetutils 2.8 (Flathub already had it) and got the same `x-checker-data` blocks as the Flathub manifest (vte, inetutils, picocom, libsecret, mc, freerdp), so flatpak-external-data-checker reports outdated pins on all three manifests consistently

### Fixed

- **Sidebar context menu not opening for rows nested deeper than the root level on some systems (reported on KDE Plasma)** ([#157](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/157)) — the menu was shown only by a per-row `GestureClick` on each `TreeExpander` (CAPTURE phase); on the reporter's environment right-clicks on nested rows never reached that gesture. A fallback `GestureClick` on the `ListView` itself (BUBBLE phase) now resolves the clicked row from the pointer coordinates via `pick()` — independent of per-row event dispatch, so it works at any nesting depth. In the normal case the per-row gesture still fires first and claims the press, cancelling the fallback; when both fire (claim propagation differs between compositors), the result is idempotent — same selection, same menu position. Item-data extraction was deduplicated into a shared `show_context_menu_for_connection_item()` helper used by the per-row gesture, the fallback, and the new keyboard path

- **Crash (SIGSEGV) in pango when opening a new SSH tab or on screen unlock — follow-up to v0.15.9** ([#171](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/171)) — debug-symbol analysis of all five crash dumps (Ubuntu 24.04 dbgsym for pango 1.52.1 and vte 0.76.0) showed the same use-after-free: `pango_itemize` → `g_object_ref()` on a freed `PangoFont`, hit during VTE's first text measurement of a freshly created terminal (`FontInfo::get_unistr_info`) inside the GTK snapshot phase. Root cause: VTE reads `gtk-fontconfig-timestamp` only when it creates its cached `FontInfo` (the timestamp is part of the font-cache key) and never subscribes to changes, so after a fontconfig update (font installation, `fc-cache`, KDE pushing `Fontconfig/Timestamp` via XSettings on screen unlock) terminals keep stale Pango font references — which is why the crash always struck right when a new tab was opened (existing tabs render from VTE's glyph cache and rarely re-itemize) and why a restart always cleared it. Two changes: (1) RustConn now listens for `gtk-fontconfig-timestamp` changes and re-applies the font on every open terminal, forcing VTE to rebuild its font cache against the new fontconfig state (`vte_terminal_set_font` deliberately recreates the font even for an unchanged description); (2) all remaining widget/VTE work in the `child-exited` handler (disconnect indicator, `terminal.reset()`, reconnect banner, auto-reconnect setup) is now deferred to the next main-loop idle instead of running inside VTE's signal emission, closing the same race the v0.15.9 fix closed for `close_tab`

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: crypto-primes 0.7.0→0.7.1, ksni 0.3.4→0.3.5, regex 1.12.3→1.12.4 (with regex-syntax 0.8.10→0.8.11), zerocopy 0.8.50→0.8.52 (with zerocopy-derive)

## [0.15.12] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

#### macOS

- **SSH password authentication always failed with "Permission denied"** ([#175](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/175)) — on macOS the terminal uses a hand-rolled native PTY (VTE's `spawn_async` does not connect the PTY to the child on the Homebrew build). The spawned child was given the PTY slave as stdin/stdout/stderr but never made it the *controlling terminal*. Since `ssh` reads the password from `/dev/tty` (not stdin) and RustConn disables askpass on macOS (`SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=never`, #161), `ssh` could not read the password, tried an empty one three times, and failed with `Permission denied (publickey,password)`. The same affected `ssh` typed manually in a Local Shell tab. The child is now placed in a new session via `setsid(2)` and claims the slave PTY as its controlling terminal via `TIOCSCTTY`, so interactive password prompts work. `setsid(2)` also supplies the process-group leadership previously set by `process_group(0)`, so job control (Ctrl-C) is preserved.

### Changed

- **New `rustconn-pty-sys` crate** — the controlling-terminal setup needs `pre_exec` (an `unsafe` API), which conflicts with the workspace-wide `unsafe_code = "forbid"`. Per the project's `M-UNSAFE` guideline, the FFI is isolated in a small dedicated crate that exposes a single safe `set_controlling_terminal()` function with a documented safety contract. The main crates keep `unsafe_code = "forbid"` untouched.

### Dependencies

- Updated `uuid` 1.23.2 → 1.23.3
- Updated `wasm-bindgen` 0.2.122 → 0.2.123 and the related `js-sys` 0.3.99 → 0.3.100, `web-sys` 0.3.99 → 0.3.100, `wasm-bindgen-futures` 0.4.72 → 0.4.73 (transitive)

## [0.15.11] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

#### Keybindings

- **Recorder did not register keystrokes on Flatpak/Wayland** ([#170](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/170), [#167](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/167)) — the inline recorder (0.15.7–0.15.10) attached an `EventControllerKey` to the toplevel window and depended on row focus, which was unreliable inside `AdwPreferencesDialog`. Replaced it with a dedicated modal `AdwDialog` (the pattern GNOME Control Center uses) that owns its own keyboard focus, so every key press is captured. Escape cancels, Backspace resets to default, conflicts still warn, and global accelerators are suspended during capture.
- **Custom shortcuts showed defaults after reopening Settings or restarting** ([#170](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/170)) — overrides were saved and applied correctly, but the UI always displayed the default. `move_groups` reparents the keybinding rows into the Interface page, leaving the page that `load_keybinding_settings` walked empty, so no label was updated. The accelerator labels are now tracked directly via a `HashMap<action, Label>` instead of walking the widget tree.

#### Snap

- **Package failed to start on Ubuntu 26.04** ([#174](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/174)) — the snap targeted `base: core26` and hand-rolled the GTK4 runtime because the `gnome` extension does not yet support core26 ([snapcraft#6185](https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft/issues/6185)), omitting `desktop-launch`, the GNOME platform and the matching AppArmor accesses. Moved to `base: core24` with `extensions: [gnome]`, which provides the complete, correctly-confined GTK4 environment. (The 0.15.10 note blaming `grade: devel` was wrong — `grade` only controls store channels.)
- **App could not register on the session D-Bus** — `g_application_register` was denied by AppArmor because a confined snap may only own names derived from the snap name, not the app ID. Added a `dbus` slot (`bus: session`, `name: io.github.totoshko88.RustConn`); the providing snap is auto-granted ownership. The Flatpak build is unaffected.
- **Transparent window and broken icons** — affected only the snap (native, Flatpak and other GTK4 snaps rendered fine). VTE must be staged (the platform omits it at runtime), but its `.deb` drags in a second copy of the whole GTK4 stack. The platform's libadwaita then bound against our `libgtk-4` (ABI mismatch → transparent window) and the platform's SVG loader against our newer `librsvg` (→ broken icons). A `prime` exclusion now drops every platform-provided GTK/GLib/render library, keeping only `libvte` itself, so a single matched copy is used process-wide.

### Changed

#### Keybindings

- **Shortcuts are stored layout-independently (Latin)** ([#170](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/170)) — recording under a non-Latin layout (e.g. Cyrillic) used to store the localised keyval, so pressing "F" produced `<Control>ф`, which stopped matching after switching back to Latin. The recorder now resolves the hardware keycode to its ASCII keyval. Function keys are unaffected.

#### Snap

- **Base `core26` → `core24`** (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS / GNOME 46 / libadwaita 1.5) — the GUI is now built **without** `--features adw-1-8`. The 1.6/1.7/1.8 widgets fall back to 1.5 equivalents (AdwSpinner → GtkSpinner, AdwToggleGroup → linked buttons, AdwShortcutsDialog → legacy dialog), preserving functionality with slightly less polish than the Flatpak (GNOME 50) build. Can return to core26 + adw-1-8 once the gnome extension supports core26.
- **CI installs Snapcraft from `latest/stable`** again (the `latest/candidate` 9.x pin was only needed for core26).
- **Added a `title`** (`RustConn`) so the Store listing and metadata linter no longer report a missing field.

## [0.15.10] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Keybinding overrides not displayed correctly after reopening Settings** — `load_keybinding_settings` and `refresh_accel_labels` used `zip` between DOM-ordered ActionRows and the `default_keybindings()` vector, but these orders diverged because Application category bindings appear in two separate groups in the vector (beginning and end) while in the UI they are merged into a single ExpanderRow. Starting from the 3rd row, each label was updated with the accelerator of a **different** action, making user-recorded shortcuts appear "not saved" on dialog reopen. Fixed by building the same category-grouped order used by `create_keybindings_page` before zipping ([#170](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/170))
- **Keybinding conflict detection ignored modifier order** — `find_accel_conflict` compared accelerator strings with plain `==`, so `<Control><Shift>w` and `<Shift><Control>w` (both representing Ctrl+Shift+W) were treated as different shortcuts. This allowed assigning a conflicting binding without any warning. Now comparison normalises modifier order (and the `<Primary>`/`<Ctrl>` aliases) before comparing key + modifiers, via a pure `accelerators_equivalent` helper in `rustconn-core` (unit-tested without a display)
- **Snap package fails to start on Ubuntu 26.04 (AppArmor error)** — the `snapcraft.yaml` still contained `build-base: devel` and `grade: devel` from the time when `core26` was experimental. Since core26 became stable (2026-04-29) and Snapcraft 9.0 added full support (2026-05-07), these keys are no longer required and caused the snap to be built with a restricted AppArmor profile that blocked access to `desktop`, `wayland`, and `opengl` interfaces. Removed `build-base: devel` and changed `grade` to `stable` ([#174](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/174))
- **SNAP.md and INSTALL.md still referenced the removed `host-usr-bin` interface** — the `system-files` plug was removed in 0.15.3 (rejected by Snap Store review), but the documentation was not updated. All references now correctly describe the on-demand CLI download mechanism via the Components dialog

### Dependencies

- Updated `bitflags` 2.12.1 → 2.13.0

## [0.15.9] - 2026-06-05

### Improved

- **Lazy init secret backends — only preferred backend is initialized** — previously opening the Settings → Secrets tab triggered keyring queries, decryption, and even Bitwarden CLI auto-unlock for ALL backends regardless of which one was configured as preferred. Now only the `preferred_backend` is initialized (decrypt + keyring load) both at startup and when opening Settings. Other backends' credentials are loaded on-demand when the user switches to them via the dropdown. Additionally, `dispatch_vault_op` now passes the service account token to 1Password, server URL and GPG passphrase to Passbolt backends, which were previously created without credentials
- **KeePass keyring failure toast at startup** — if the system keyring does not respond within 5 seconds or returns no password, a toast is shown after the main window appears: "KeePass password not loaded from keyring — re-enter it in Settings" with a clickable "Settings" button that opens the Preferences dialog directly. Previously the failure was only logged, leaving users confused when vault-based connections silently failed
- **Connection wizard: ComboRow model lazy init** — the auth method `ComboRow` model is now created empty and populated only when `configure_for_protocol()` is called, eliminating a brief flash of all 4 SSH methods during page transition animations for non-SSH protocols

### Fixed

- **macOS: Option key not producing composed characters in terminal** — on macOS with non-US keyboard layouts (German, French, etc.), `Option+L` should produce `@` (German) but was instead treated as Alt+L sending escape sequences to the PTY. Added a new "Option as Meta key" setting (Settings → Terminal → Behavior, macOS only) that defaults to off. When off, Option+key combinations produce the composed character from the active keyboard layout. When on, Option sends ESC-prefixed sequences (for vim/emacs users). The fix intercepts Option+key in GTK Capture phase before VTE's internal Alt handler, checks if GDK resolved a printable Unicode character from the macOS IMContext, and feeds it directly to the PTY ([#173](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/173))
- **KeePass vault credentials not resolved on Flatpak after restart** — when the KeePass database password was stored in the system keyring (default for Flatpak), it was not loaded at startup — only when the user opened Settings. This caused connections with `password_source = Vault` to show "Secret Backend Not Configured" or prompt for a password instead of reading it from the KDBX file. Now the keyring is queried during `AppState` initialization, matching the existing Bitwarden credential restore flow ([#170](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/170))
- **Crash (SIGSEGV) when opening new SSH tab or on screen lock/unlock** — three crash scenarios caused by VTE use-after-free during GTK widget snapshot phase. When `close_on_clean_exit` was enabled, `close_tab()` was called synchronously from within VTE's `child-exited` signal handler, destroying the widget while GTK still had a pending render scheduled for the current frame. Additionally, after SSH disconnect the VTE terminal could hold stale Pango font references that became invalid on screen lock/unlock (GPU context loss). Fix: (1) defer `close_tab` via `glib::idle_add_local_once` so the tab is destroyed after the current frame completes, (2) call `terminal.reset()` in `mark_tab_disconnected` to release stale Pango resources before the next snapshot cycle ([#171](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/171))
- **Connection wizard: auth method label overflow** — the "Method" label in the Authentication step was broken into individual characters ("M-e-t-h-od") because four radio buttons placed horizontally as an `ActionRow` suffix exceeded the available width. Replaced radio buttons with `adw::ComboRow` dropdown which fits any dialog width and follows GNOME HIG patterns ([#169](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/169))
- **Telnet connection not closed when closing the tab** — the `telnet` process was not terminated when the connection tab was closed, leaving established TCP connections in ESTABLISHED state in the background. The root cause: VTE closes the PTY master fd on widget destroy, which sends SIGHUP to the child, but telnet (and some other CLI clients) does not exit on SIGHUP while a TCP session is active. Fix: store the VTE child PID after `spawn_async` and explicitly send SIGTERM to the process group (`kill(-pid, SIGTERM)`) when the tab is closed. Also applies to Serial and other VTE-spawned protocols ([#172](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/172))
- **1Password/Passbolt credentials not passed in vault entry lookups** — `retrieve_by_vault_entry_name`, connection dialog password preview, and CLI `secret` commands created backend instances without service account token (1Password) or server URL and GPG passphrase (Passbolt). Custom vault entry names and CLI operations failed silently for these backends. Now all code paths pass credentials from settings consistently. Passbolt backend now accepts `--userPassword` flag for GPG passphrase authentication without relying on the CLI config file
- **Connection wizard: redundant Method dropdown for non-SSH protocols** — RDP/VNC/SPICE connections showed a ComboRow with a single "Password" option which was pointless. The method selector is now hidden for protocols that only support password authentication

## [0.15.8] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Keybinding reassignment not registering keystrokes** — the 0.15.7 fix (suspending accelerators) was necessary but not sufficient: after the Record button becomes insensitive it loses keyboard focus, leaving GTK4 with no target widget for key event propagation. Additionally, `AdwPreferencesDialog` with `search_enabled=true` installs a `key_capture_widget` on its internal `SearchEntry` that intercepts letter keys in bubble phase. Now the recorder (1) moves focus to the parent `ActionRow` so GTK4 has a valid propagation target, and (2) temporarily disables PreferencesDialog search during recording to eliminate `SearchEntry` interference. Both are restored on recording completion or cancellation ([#167](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/167))
- **Sidebar: right-click context menu not appearing for hosts in groups** — on Wayland with multiple groups, the `empty_space_gesture` on `ScrolledWindow` (bubble phase) could race with the per-item gesture on `TreeExpander` (capture phase): both handlers fired for the same right-click event, causing `empty_space_gesture` to call `close_active_popover()` and immediately destroy the item context menu that had just opened. Now `empty_space_gesture` checks via `pick()` + `ancestor(TreeExpander)` whether the click landed on an actual row and bails out if so. Additionally fixed a memory leak where `focus-widget` signal handlers accumulated on the window (never disconnected after popover close) and eliminated double `unparent()` calls that produced GTK critical warnings ([#168](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/168))
- **Secret variable with vault entry name wrote duplicate entry to vault** — when a secret variable had a custom "Vault entry" name (e.g., `AD Credentials`), saving still wrote the password under the default `rustconn/var/{name}` key, creating an unnecessary duplicate in Bitwarden/1Password/Passbolt/Pass. Now variables with a vault entry reference are treated as read-only — nothing is written back to the vault ([#166](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/166))
- **Sidebar: status icon size inconsistent with custom icons** — the connection status indicator (green checkmark / red stop) appeared larger for connections with a custom emoji icon because the sibling-based widget navigation found the wrong `Image` widget when an emoji label was prepended. Now status icons are located by CSS class (`status-icon`) and the main connection icon has a fixed `pixel_size(16)`, ensuring uniform 10px status indicators for all connection types

### Improved

- **Variable dialog: vault entry UX hints** — when the "Vault entry" field is filled, the password field placeholder changes to "Fetched from vault at connect time" to indicate no manual password input is needed. Updated tooltip explains that nothing is written back to the vault ([#166](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/166))

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: chrono 0.4.44→0.4.45, log 0.4.31→0.4.32, yoke 0.8.2→0.8.3

## [0.15.7] - 2026-06-03

### Improved

- **Variable password source: discoverability** — when "Variable" is selected as password source in the connection or group dialog, the row now shows a subtitle hint ("Create secret variables in Tools → Variables") and a "+" button that opens the global variables manager directly. Previously the dropdown appeared empty with no guidance, making the feature appear broken for users who had not yet created secret variables ([#166](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/166))
- **Variable password source: custom vault entry name** — secret variables can now reference an existing entry in Bitwarden, 1Password, Passbolt, or Pass by its exact name (e.g., "AD Credentials") instead of the default `rustconn/var/{name}` lookup key. This is the non-KeePass equivalent of the existing "KeePass entry" field — both allow reusing credentials already stored in the vault without duplication. Configure via Tools → Variables → mark as Secret → fill "Vault entry" field ([#166](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/166))

### Fixed

- **Proxmox SPICE: inline PEM CA certificate now saved automatically** — when importing a `.vv` file from Proxmox VE that contains an inline PEM CA certificate (common in SPICE tickets), the certificate is now automatically saved to `~/.local/share/rustconn/certs/ca-<hash>.pem` and the path is set in connection settings. Previously the import only showed a warning asking the user to save the certificate manually, which was impractical because Proxmox tickets expire in 30–40 seconds. Now the connection works immediately after import via file manager or `rustconn file.vv` ([#165](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/165))
- **Keybinding reassignment not working** — recording a new keyboard shortcut in Settings → Interface did not register keystrokes because global application accelerators (e.g. `Ctrl+W`) intercepted the key event before the recording controller could receive it. Now all accelerators are temporarily suspended during recording and the `EventControllerKey` uses the Capture phase, ensuring any key combination reaches the recorder ([#167](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/167))
- **Sidebar: right-click context menu still not working at depth ≥ 2** — the 0.15.6 fix moved the gesture from `TreeExpander` to `content_box`, but `content_box` does not cover the indent/arrow area that `TreeExpander` renders to the left of the content for nested items. Right-clicks landing in the indent area (which grows wider at each nesting level) never reached `content_box` and were silently ignored. Moved the gesture back to the `TreeExpander` widget with `BUTTON_SECONDARY` — this does not conflict with TreeExpander's internal expand/collapse handler which only listens for `BUTTON_PRIMARY` ([#157](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/157))

## [0.15.6] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **VNC: Accept Certificate option** — new "Accept Certificate" toggle in VNC connection settings allows connecting to VNC servers with self-signed or untrusted TLS certificates (VeNCrypt). When enabled, the external viewer (TigerVNC) receives `-SecurityTypes VeNCrypt,TLSVnc,X509Vnc,VncAuth,None` arguments. The embedded VNC client auto-fallbacks to the external viewer with proper security types when VeNCrypt is detected. CLI `--ignore-certificate` now works for both RDP and VNC connections ([#164](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/164))

### Fixed

- **Welcome screen: "Remote host monitoring" icon missing on macOS** — replaced `speedometer-symbolic` (not part of the standard Adwaita icon theme bundle) with `power-profile-performance-symbolic` (same icon used in Settings → Monitoring tab) which is available across all platforms
- **Sidebar: right-click context menu not opening for nested items** — context menu gesture was attached to the `TreeExpander` widget, whose internal indent/arrow gesture silently swallowed right-click events for items at depth ≥ 1; moved the gesture controller to the content box inside the expander, bypassing the conflict ([#157](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/157))

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: bitflags 2.11.1→2.12.1, log 0.4.30→0.4.31, lzma-rust2 0.16.2→0.16.4. Removed: sha2 0.10.9 (unused transitive dependency)
- **Flathub**: inetutils 2.7→2.8

## [0.15.5] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **IronRDP 0.15 (bulk compression)** — RDP sessions now negotiate XCRUSH (RDP 6.1) compression in Quality/Balanced modes and MPPC-64K in Speed mode, significantly reducing bandwidth for slow connections. Compression is handled transparently by the new `ironrdp-bulk` crate.
- **IronRDP 0.15 (slow-path rendering)** — sessions with servers that use slow-path output (XRDP, older Windows) now render correctly instead of showing blank screens. Both slow-path bitmap and pointer updates are routed through the existing rendering pipeline.
- **IronRDP 0.15 (alternate_shell/work_dir)** — RemoteApp `program` and `working_dir` are now passed via the native `alternate_shell`/`work_dir` fields in the Client Info PDU, enabling CyberArk PSM and custom shell scenarios without FreeRDP.
- **IronRDP 0.15 (improved compatibility)** — connection to GNOME Remote Desktop (grd) no longer fails on `ServerDeactivateAll` during CapabilitiesExchange; all colour depths are advertised per FreeRDP pattern (fixes Windows Server 2012+ with 24bpp); Auto-Detect Request PDUs no longer crash the session; bitmap updates exceeding buffer bounds after resize are safely skipped.
- **IronRDP 0.15 (multitransport dispatch)** — `MultitransportRequest` and `AutoDetect` PDUs are now logged instead of causing unhandled-PDU errors. UDP sideband transport is not yet implemented but the session stays alive.
- **IronRDP 0.15 (clipboard file contents)** — `SendFileContentsRequest`/`SendFileContentsResponse` clipboard messages are now gracefully handled (logged, not yet implemented for full file copy).
- **IronRDP 0.15 (pixel format fix)** — removed manual R↔B channel swap in `extract_region_data`; IronRDP 0.15 fixed the pixel format pipeline so BgrA32 output now directly matches Cairo's ARGB32 (both are B-G-R-A in memory on little-endian). This eliminates a per-frame O(w×h) loop, improving 4K rendering throughput.

### Fixed

- **macOS: passwords not saving to Keychain** — `dispatch_vault_op()` incorrectly used `LibSecretBackend` (which shells out to `secret-tool`, a Linux-only utility) for the `MacOsKeychain` backend type. Now correctly instantiates `MacOsKeychainBackend` (Security.framework) on macOS. Users saw a generic "Failed to save password to vault" toast with no further details.
- **macOS: tray icon missing when launched from .app bundle** — the root cause was `exec()` (re-exec) breaking the macOS LaunchServices "scene" registration for `NSStatusItem`. Replaced `setup_macos_bundle_env()` (which used `exec()` to set env vars) with `configure_macos_bundle()` which programmatically configures all subsystems without re-exec: `i18n::locale_dir()` now detects the bundle's `Contents/Resources/locale` path directly, icon search paths were already added programmatically in `register_app_icon()`, and `get_extended_path()` already handles PATH for child processes. `CFBundleExecutable` in Info.plist now points to the native `rustconn` binary with no wrapper or re-exec needed. **Note**: on macOS Sequoia 15.5, tray icon is not displayed when launched via Finder/Dock due to a GTK4 GDK macOS backend limitation (FrontBoardServices scene registration failure); works correctly when launched from terminal.
- **macOS: AWS SSM "session-manager-plugin not found"** — added `/usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin/bin` to `get_extended_path()` on macOS for users who install the plugin via the official AWS installer (not Homebrew). Documented the separate installation requirement in `ZERO_TRUST.md` and `MACOS_BUILD.md`.

### Changed

- **Compact mode: denser sidebar rows** — vertical margins reduced from 6px to 3px per row, allowing ~60px more visible content for 10 connections
- **Compact mode: slimmer sidebar bottom toolbar** — button min-height reduced from default to 22px with tighter padding
- **Compact mode: smaller search/filter bar** — search entry min-height reduced to 26px with slightly smaller font
- **Compact mode: popover menu item padding** — all popover menus (hamburger, context, tab) use less vertical padding per item, significantly reducing menu height on small screens
- **Compact mode: smaller protocol filter buttons** — denser filter pills matching overall compact density
- **Compact mode: denser RDP/VNC/SPICE toolbar** — embedded session toolbar (Copy, Paste, Autotype, Ctrl+Alt+Del) uses reduced margins and button height in compact mode, giving more vertical space to the remote desktop viewport
- **Compact mode enabled by default on macOS** — new installations on macOS start with compact interface active; existing users keep their saved preference
- **Hamburger menu restructured into submenus** — "Tools" (Snippets, Clusters, Templates, Variables, Password Generator, Wake On LAN, SSH Tunnels) and "Sessions" (Active Sessions, History, Statistics, Recordings) are now submenus; Import/Export/Copy/Paste merged into a single "File" section. Top-level menu reduced from 24 items to ~14, dramatically reducing vertical height on macOS

### Dependencies

- **Upgraded**: ironrdp 0.14→0.15, ironrdp-tokio 0.8→0.9, ironrdp-connector 0.8→0.9, ironrdp-session 0.8→0.9, ironrdp-cliprdr 0.5→0.6, ironrdp-rdpdr 0.5→0.6, ironrdp-rdpsnd 0.7→0.8, ironrdp-dvc 0.5→0.6, ironrdp-displaycontrol 0.5→0.6, ironrdp-graphics 0.7→0.8, ironrdp-pdu 0.7→0.8, ironrdp-core 0.1→0.2, ironrdp-svc 0.6→0.7. New transitive: ironrdp-bulk 0.1.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **macOS: UI hang when editing connection with broken ssh-agent** — when the system `ssh-agent` is unhealthy or launchd-throttled, opening the Edit Connection dialog no longer freezes the GTK main thread; `ConnectionDialog::refresh_agent_keys()` now probes the agent asynchronously on a background thread with a 5-second timeout, showing "Loading agent keys…" while the probe runs; if the agent does not respond in time the child process is killed and the dropdown shows "No keys loaded" without blocking the UI ([#163](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/163))
- **macOS: SSH Tunnel Manager showed native traffic lights** — migrated from `adw::Window` to `adw::Dialog` for consistent cross-platform presentation (× close button in header bar, same as all other dialogs)
- **macOS: Settings dialog tabs truncated** — increased `content_width` to 1000px on macOS so all 6 ViewSwitcher tabs display without ellipsis (Linux remains 800px)
- **macOS: clippy warnings** — fixed `useless_conversion` in `rdpdr.rs` (inverted `cfg_attr`), `new_without_default` and `redundant_clone` in `macos_keychain.rs`, `case_sensitive_file_extension_comparisons` in `main.rs`, `collapsible_if` in `macos_pty.rs` and `window/mod.rs`, `single_match_else` / `while_let_loop` / `useless_conversion` / `if_not_else` in `tray.rs`, `needless_return` in `edit_actions.rs`, `items_after_statements` in `dialog.rs`, unused `PtyFlags` import in `terminal/mod.rs`
- **`release.sh` crash on macOS (bash 3.2)** — replaced `declare -A` associative arrays (bash 4+ only) with parallel indexed arrays compatible with macOS default bash
- **`release.sh` clippy failure on macOS** — added platform detection to run clippy with `--no-default-features --features tray-macos,...` on Darwin, avoiding the missing `gtk4-wayland` pkg-config error

### Added

- **`scripts/macos-build.sh`** — one-command build + `.app` bundle creation for macOS development. Handles cargo build with correct features, icon generation, locale compilation, Adwaita icon bundling, ad-hoc code signing, and launch. Supports `--release`, `--no-launch`, `--clean` flags.

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: kqueue 1.1.1→1.2.0, libz-sys 1.1.28→1.1.29, rpassword 7.5.3→7.5.4

## [0.15.3] - 2026-05-30

Snap packaging now reaches feature parity with the Flatpak build and is on a current GNOME runtime.

### Changed

- **Snap base bumped to `core26` (Ubuntu 26.04 / GNOME 50).** The previous `core24` base only provides libadwaita 1.5, while the UI targets libadwaita 1.8 — the same version the Flatpak GNOME 50 runtime ships. The snap now builds the GUI crate with `--features adw-1-8` via an explicit workspace `cargo build` in `override-build` (the plugin's `rust-features` key applies `--features` per-crate, which would fail on `rustconn-cli`, so we drive cargo directly, mirroring the Flatpak manifest).
- **Removed the `system-files` (`host-usr-bin`) plug from the snap.** The Snap Store review rejected executing host binaries (`-1` on the privileged request); bundled embedded clients plus on-demand CLI downloads replace it. The `personal-files` plugs (`aws`/`gcloud`/`azure`/`oci`/`kube-credentials`) remain and are intended for manual connection, matching the reviewer's `+1`.
- **Renamed the "Flatpak Components" dialog/menu to "Components".** The external-CLI download manager is no longer Flatpak-specific.

### Added

- **External CLI tools can now be downloaded on demand inside the snap**, mirroring the Flatpak mechanism. CLIs install into `$SNAP_USER_DATA/cli/` and are added to the connection-launch `PATH`; cloud CLI config dirs (gcloud, Azure, Teleport, OCI) are redirected to writable `$SNAP_USER_DATA/.config/<tool>` locations with credential bootstrap from the host's read-only `personal-files` mounts. `python3` is now staged so the pip-based `az`/`oci` CLIs work.
- **`rustconn_core::is_sandboxed()`** — single predicate (`is_snap() || is_flatpak()`) now gates all sandbox-specific CLI logic instead of Flatpak-only checks, so snap and Flatpak share one code path.
- **Snap confinement guidance for personal-files plugs.** `get_confinement_message()` now detects when cloud credential directories exist on the host but are inaccessible (plug not connected) and shows the exact `sudo snap connect rustconn:<plug>` command to run.

### Fixed

- **Broken Ukrainian translation for the Protocol Clients section.** The Components dialog subtitle was garbled ("Убудовані Першорядні - це клієнти…") — now correctly reads "Необов'язкові для зовнішніх з'єднань RDP/VNC/SPICE. Перевагу мають вбудовані клієнти (IronRDP, vnc-rs)."
- **All 16 language catalogs updated for the "Components" rename.** Removed stale "Flatpak" from translations and cleared fuzzy flags so the menu/dialog title is properly localized in all languages.

### Documentation

- **Zero Trust guide updated for snap.** Added a "Sandbox note (Flatpak & Snap)" block explaining how CLI tools are installed and how credential directories are accessed in both sandboxed distributions.
- **Bitwarden setup guide updated for snap.** Sections now reference both Flatpak and Snap paths; "Flatpak Components" → "Components" throughout.

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: hyper 1.10.0→1.10.1, typenum 1.20.0→1.20.1, uuid 1.23.1→1.23.2, zbus 5.15.0→5.16.0, zbus_macros 5.15.0→5.16.0, zerocopy 0.8.49→0.8.50, zerocopy-derive 0.8.49→0.8.50, zvariant 5.11.0→5.12.0, zvariant_derive 5.11.0→5.12.0, zvariant_utils 3.3.1→3.4.0

## [0.15.2] - 2026-05-29

A small code-hygiene and documentation release. No user-facing behaviour changes — the goal is to remove misleading lint reasons, drop a dead field, replace a `unwrap()` in the CLI with a proper error path, and bring the keyboard-shortcut documentation back in sync with the code.

### Improved

- **Corrected misleading `#[allow]`/`#[expect]` reasons.** A copy-pasted `reason = "kept alive for GTK widget lifecycle / future API exposure"` had spread into `rustconn-core` (a crate that never touches GTK) and into property tests, where it made no sense. Each site now carries an accurate reason: float comparisons against exactly-representable constants (`0.0`, `100.0`), bounded `f64`→`u32` truncation in drop-index tests, reserved test fixtures and proptest strategies, and the long sequential body of `start_collector`. Lints that fire are now `#[expect]`; genuinely-reserved test helpers stay `#[allow(dead_code)]` with honest reasons.
- **Removed a dead field in `DirectoryWatcher`.** `notify_tx` stored a throwaway `mpsc::channel().0` (the real sender lives inside the watcher closure) and only existed behind an `#[allow(dead_code)]`. The field and its allow attribute are gone; behaviour is unchanged.
- **Keyboard-shortcut help dialog now lists every action.** The in-app shortcuts dialog (Ctrl+?) was a hand-maintained list that had drifted from the keybinding registry: it was missing SSH Tunnel Manager (Ctrl+T), Open Primary Menu (F10), the Ctrl+W close-tab alias, and the font-zoom shortcuts (Ctrl+Plus / Ctrl+Minus / Ctrl+0). Those are now included, and a new unit test (`registry_accelerators_are_documented_in_dialog`) fails if a future registry entry is ever left undocumented.

### Fixed

- **`rustconn-cli update` no longer relies on `unwrap()`.** Locating the connection index after `find_connection` used `.position(...).unwrap()`; it now returns a `CliError::Config` instead of panicking in the (logically unreachable) case where the connection vanishes between lookups, satisfying the project's no-`unwrap` rule.

### Documentation

- **Corrected keyboard shortcuts in the User Guide.** "Create Group" was documented as Ctrl+Shift+N (which actually opens New Connection (Advanced)); the correct shortcut is **Ctrl+Shift+G**. Removed the non-existent **Ctrl+K** "Search" binding (only Ctrl+F is registered) and added the missing **Ctrl+Shift+B** (Toggle Split Broadcast) row.
- **Zero Trust guide synced with the implementation.** Bumped the version header to 0.15.2; corrected the Generic Command section — the command template is run verbatim through `sh -c` and is **not** processed for `${host}`/`${user}`/`${port}` placeholders (the previous text wrongly promised substitution); and fixed the Hoop.dev Flatpak section — `~/.hoop/` is **not** mounted by default (the permission was rejected by Flathub lint), so access must be granted manually via `flatpak override` or supplied through the `HOOP_*` environment variables. The misleading placeholder comment on `GenericZeroTrustConfig` in `rustconn-core` was corrected to match.
- **Bitwarden setup guide corrected.** Removed a duplicated paragraph in the install section; the "Architecture Notes" now describe the actual vault layout (item name `RustConn: rustconn/<connection-name>`, URI `rustconn://<lookup-key>`, notes holding only the connection's domain as a plain string — not JSON, and no key passphrase); and the troubleshooting command now uses the correct keyring attribute (`secret-tool search application rustconn`, not `service`).

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: cc 1.2.62→1.2.63, cfg-expr 0.20.7→0.20.8, shlex 1.3.0→2.0.1, target-lexicon 0.13.3→0.13.5 (transitive build dependencies; no API impact)

## [0.15.1] - 2026-05-29

A focused fix for the Flatpak language-switch bug ([#158](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/158)).

### Fixed

- **Flatpak: language switch had no effect for any of the 16 translations.** Translations were installed under `/app/share/locale/<lang>/`, which `flatpak-builder` automatically splits into per-language subsets of `org.gnome.Platform.Locale`. The host pulls in only the subset matching the user's system locale, so a user with `LANG=en_US` literally had no `rustconn.mo` file in the sandbox and could not switch the UI language to anything else, no matter what was selected in Settings. Translations now install to `/app/share/rustconn/locale/` (a path `flatpak-builder` does not touch) and the manifest sets `--env=LOCALEDIR=/app/share/rustconn/locale`. The existing `i18n::locale_dir()` resolution order already honors `LOCALEDIR` first, so no application code changed.
  - Affects the published Flathub manifest, the GitHub release manifest, and the local development manifest.
  - Verified: a `find /app -name 'rustconn.mo'` in the sandbox now lists all 16 languages instead of zero.

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: mio 1.2.0→1.2.1, socket2 0.6.3→0.6.4

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-27

A focused quality-and-cleanup release. No new user-facing features — the goal is to retire technical debt and make the codebase easier to evolve. 

### Security

- **RDP RemoteApp no longer passes `/p:` on the command line.** RemoteApp launches now write a single-use `.rdp` args file in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` with mode 0600 containing only the password switch, and FreeRDP reads it via `/args-from:file:<path>`. The temp file is removed on `Drop` even if the launcher panics or returns early. Closes the [#153](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/153) Known Issue from 0.14.10.

### Improved

- **`#[allow]` → `#[expect(reason = "…")]` migration.** Every clippy/compiler override now carries an explanatory `reason = "…"` string and uses `#[expect]` where the lint actively fires (around 350 sites across all three crates). Stale overrides surface as warnings during code review instead of silently accumulating. Workspace lint `clippy::allow_attributes_without_reason = "warn"` enforces the new rule, and the migration uncovered roughly 50 overrides whose underlying lint no longer triggers — those were dropped entirely.
- **Manual `Debug` impls for secret backends.** `BitwardenBackend`, `KeePassXcBackend`, `LibSecretBackend`, `MacOsKeychainBackend`, `OnePasswordBackend`, `PassBackend`, `PassboltBackend`, `SecretManager`, and `CredentialResolver` now render meaningful `Debug` output (backend kind, server address, whether a session is held) without leaking session keys or passwords. Each backend file ships a `debug_does_not_leak_secret` unit test.
- **CLI `# Errors` documentation.** Every public `cmd_*` function in `rustconn-cli/src/commands/` now lists the `CliError` variants it can return, satisfying `clippy::missing_errors_doc` for the package.
- **GUI spacing follows GNOME HIG.** All `set_margin_*` / `set_spacing` calls in `rustconn/src/` use the HIG steps (6 / 12 / 18 / 24 px); legacy 4 px values were rounded up to 6 px and 8 px values rounded up to 12 px (about 520 sites).
- **`EntryRowBuilder::new` requires pre-translated titles.** Callers now pass `&i18n("Kubeconfig")` instead of `"Kubeconfig"`, so `xgettext` extracts every UI label and translators see them in `po/*.po`. Previously several rows in Kubernetes / Serial / Telnet / Cluster / Smart Folder dialogs stayed untranslated forever.

### Fixed

- **Settings-save failures now surface a toast.** `update_settings` results in `rustconn/src/window/smart_folders.rs` and `rustconn/src/window/connection_actions.rs` are no longer dropped silently with `let _ = …`; recoverable errors log a `tracing::warn!` and the active window shows a toast so the user knows the change did not stick.

## [0.14.10] - 2026-05-27

This release focuses on hardening how passwords flow through the app, removing several places where plaintext credentials could linger on the heap longer than necessary, plus a few startup-robustness and HIG-compliance fixes.

### Security

- **Vault save paths now take `SecretString` directly.** `save_password_to_vault`, `save_group_password_to_vault` and `save_variable_to_vault` no longer accept `&str`. Callers in `edit_group.rs`, `connection_dialogs.rs`, `dialogs/connection/builders.rs` and the variable-setup dialog wrap the contents of password entries into `SecretString` (or `Zeroizing<String>`) immediately on capture, so plaintext is never stored in a long-lived `String`.
- **Backend deserializers wrap secrets at parse time.** Bitwarden, KeePassXC, Passbolt, RDM and libvirt responses deserialize their password fields straight into `Option<SecretString>` via a shared helper. Previously the JSON/XML parser would allocate a plain `String` on the heap and that value lingered until the caller manually wrapped it.
- **Bitwarden GUI unlock no longer logs `password_len`.** Logging the length of a master password narrows brute-force search space; replaced with a `has_password` boolean. The master password is held in `Zeroizing<String>` for the duration of the `bw unlock` invocation.

### Added

- **Close tab on clean session exit** — new switch in Settings → Terminal. When enabled, tabs auto-close after a clean shell exit (typing `exit` or `logout`, exit code 0) instead of showing the reconnect overlay. Disabled by default. ([#162](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/162))
- **`Ctrl+W` closes the active tab** — alongside the existing `Ctrl+Shift+W`. On macOS this maps to `Cmd+W` via GTK4's modifier translation. ([#162](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/162))
- **F10 opens the primary menu.** The header-bar burger button is now marked as the primary menu, so GTK4 binds F10 to it automatically — required by GNOME HIG.

### Improved

- **Graceful exit when Tokio runtime fails to start.** Instead of panicking, RustConn now prints a hint about ulimits / sandbox restrictions and exits with code 2.
- **Password generator surfaces RNG failures.** A failure inside `ring::SystemRandom::fill` (rare; possible in heavily restricted sandboxes) now returns `PasswordGeneratorError::RngError` instead of panicking.
- **`SyncManager::try_recv_export` returns `Option<Uuid>`** instead of `Result<Uuid, ()>` — the absence of a queued export is normal control flow, not an error.
- **Named timeout constants** for HTTP downloads (`HTTP_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT`), Bitwarden unlock (`BITWARDEN_UNLOCK_TIMEOUT`), and vault retrieval (`VAULT_RETRIEVE_TIMEOUT`) replace eight scattered `Duration::from_secs(...)` literals.
- **Doc comments**: added `# Errors` sections to the public KeePass helpers in `secret/status.rs` (`get_password_from_kdbx_with_key`, `get_password_from_kdbx_exact`, `verify_kdbx_credentials`, `validate_key_file_path`) and to `vault_ops::save_variable_to_vault`.
- **`Debug` for protocol handlers and small types** — derived for the eleven zero-sized `*Protocol` handlers, `SshTunnelParams`, `TunnelPreviewParams`; manual implementation for `BusyStack` / `BusyGuard` that does not expose the internal callback.

### Fixed

- **macOS: SSH fails with `ssh-askpass: No such file or directory`.** SSH was trying to invoke the XQuartz askpass binary at `/usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass` even though RustConn handles password input natively via VTE injection. The terminal environment now sets `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=never` on macOS to suppress external askpass invocation. ([#161](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/161))

### Dependencies

- `displaydoc` 0.2.5 → 0.2.6
- `hyper` 1.9.0 → 1.10.0
- `libredox` 0.1.16 → 0.1.17
- `memchr` 2.8.0 → 2.8.1
- `toml_edit` 0.25.11 → 0.25.12
- `zerocopy` 0.8.48 → 0.8.49
- `zerocopy-derive` 0.8.48 → 0.8.49

### Known Issues

- **RDP RemoteApp passed the password via the `/p:` cmdline argument**, visible in `/proc/PID/cmdline` to other processes of the same uid. Tracked in [#153](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/153) and **fixed in 0.15.0** via single-use args files in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.

## [0.14.9] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Server Manager** quick action in the RDP embedded toolbar (Windows admin tools menu).

### Improved

- Windows admin tools menu is now grouped with a separator: quick shortcuts (Settings, Task Manager) are separated from admin consoles (sorted alphabetically).

### Fixed

- Split view: panels with sessions moved via Select Tab lost their content ("Loading...") on subsequent splits — terminal was not stored in the internal map for restoration after `rebuild_widgets()`.
- RemoteApp: sessions now correctly use external FreeRDP mode instead of embedded wlfreerdp — RAIL protocol requires its own window management which is incompatible with Wayland subsurface embedding. ([#153](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/153))
- RemoteApp: use `xfreerdp3` via `flatpak-spawn --host` in Flatpak sandbox since only xfreerdp supports RAIL/RemoteApp (wlfreerdp and sdl-freerdp do not). ([#153](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/153))
- RemoteApp: updated `/app:` argument format to FreeRDP 3.x syntax (`/app:program:<path>,cmd:<args>,name:<name>`). ([#153](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/153))
- RemoteApp: force NTLM authentication (`/auth-pkg-list:ntlm`) for host-launched xfreerdp3 to avoid Kerberos realm misconfiguration on standalone servers. ([#153](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/153))
- RemoteApp: pass password via `/p:` argument for RemoteApp sessions (FreeRDP 3.x `/from-stdin` requires interactive input incompatible with pipe-based stdin). ([#153](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/153))

### Known Issues

- RemoteApp (RAIL) windows do not appear on Wayland sessions due to an upstream xfreerdp3 bug — RAIL app windows fail to create via XWayland (`xf_Pointer: Invalid appWindow`). Workaround: use an X11 session or full desktop RDP instead. ([FreeRDP#8071](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues/8071), [FreeRDP#12485](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues/12485))

## [0.14.8] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Compact interface mode** — toggle in Settings → Interface reduces header bar height to 32 px, tab bar to 28 px, and button padding throughout. Saves ~28-32 px of vertical space. ([#157](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/157))
- **Split-view broadcast toggle** — header-bar button mirrors keystrokes from any panel to all other panels in the same split. Hidden when no split is active. Shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+B`. ([#160](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/160))

### Improved

- Broadcast toggle gets accent background + pulse animation when active; one-shot discoverability toast on first eligible split.
- Tray icon uses a dedicated SVG with cream halo for visibility on dark KDE/Plasma panels. ([#157](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/157))

### Fixed

- Broadcast toggle now appears after panels filled via Select Tab (uses `active_session_count()` instead of `session_count()`).
- Broadcast no longer doubles every typed character (shared `broadcast_busy` re-entrancy guard across all wired handlers).
- Broadcast rewired around split view instead of clusters — works for any terminal session, not just cluster members. ([#160](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/160))
- Broadcast wires new sessions placed via Select Tab while broadcast is already on (previously required toggle off/on).
- Language change now applies in Flatpak — only `LANGUAGE` is passed across re-exec; `LC_MESSAGES` inherited from host. ([#158](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/158))
- Cluster dialog no longer shows defunct "Broadcast mode" switch; CLI `--broadcast` flag emits deprecation warning.

### Dependencies

- `http` 1.4.0 → 1.4.1
- `log` 0.4.29 → 0.4.30

## [0.14.7] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Visual Tunnel Builder** — 3-step wizard dialog for creating and editing SSH tunnels with a visual path diagram (localhost → bastion → target), SSH command preview, and real-time status indicators. Step 1: select SSH connection, name the tunnel, optionally configure jump host. Step 2: add port forwarding rules (Local -L, Remote -R, Dynamic -D), configure auto-start/reconnect. Step 3: review configuration, see generated SSH command, copy to clipboard. Replaces the previous flat dialog in the Tunnel Manager window.
- **Keyboard passthrough mode** — press Ctrl+Shift+Backspace to disable all application shortcuts and pass keys directly to the remote session (VTE terminal, embedded RDP/VNC/SPICE viewer). Essential for using nvim, tmux, or other TUI apps that conflict with RustConn keybindings. Toggle via shortcut, menu (☰ → Keyboard Passthrough), or command palette. Only Quit (Ctrl+Q), Fullscreen (F11), and the passthrough toggle itself remain active. A toast notification confirms the mode change. ([#159](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/159))

### Improved

- **Visual Tunnel Builder: live diagram on Step 1** — the path diagram now updates in real time when changing the SSH connection or jump host selection, providing immediate visual feedback of the tunnel chain
- **Visual Tunnel Builder: live diagram on Step 2** — the path diagram now updates automatically when adding, editing, or deleting port forwarding rules, reflecting the first rule's direction and target
- **Visual Tunnel Builder: validation before Review** — Step 2 now validates all port forwarding rules (remote host required for Local/Remote) before allowing navigation to Step 3
- **Visual Tunnel Builder: "Add Forward" button placement** — moved to `PreferencesGroup` header suffix (GNOME HIG pattern) for better discoverability
- **Visual Tunnel Builder: accessibility** — status changes now announce both the tunnel path and status to screen readers (e.g., "Tunnel: localhost:8080 → bastion → target:80. Status: Running"); diagram container uses `Role::Img` for correct AT semantics
- **Visual Tunnel Builder: empty state** — replaced manual icon+label layout with `adw::StatusPage` for consistent GNOME HIG empty state presentation
- **Visual Tunnel Builder: UTF-8 safe error truncation** — error messages in tooltip are now truncated by character count instead of byte offset, preventing potential panics on multi-byte text
- **Keyboard passthrough: persistent header bar indicator** — a warning-styled "Passthrough" button now appears in the header bar while passthrough mode is active, providing persistent visual feedback and one-click disable; complements the existing toast notification
- **VNC client: connection timeout** — embedded VNC client now respects the configured `timeout_secs` (default 30s) instead of relying on OS-level TCP timeout which could hang for 2+ minutes on unreachable hosts
- **Document encryption: key zeroization** — derived encryption keys are now wrapped in `Zeroizing<[u8; 32]>` ensuring automatic memory clearing on drop (defense-in-depth hardening)
- **Welcome screen: streamlined shortcuts** — combined "Split vertical" and "Split horizontal" into a single entry; added keyboard passthrough shortcut for discoverability

## [0.14.6] - 2026-05-23

### Improved

- **Variables dialog: collapsible rows** — each variable is now shown as a collapsible expander displaying only the name; when adding a new variable, all existing rows collapse and the new one opens expanded with focus on the name field; improves usability with many variables
- **Variables dialog: duplicate name validation** — saving is blocked when two or more variables share the same name (case-insensitive); duplicate entries are highlighted with error styling and auto-expanded so the user can fix them
- **RDP toolbar: deduplicated admin menu** — removed PowerShell and CMD from the quick actions menu (⋮) since they are already available in Shell Launchers (+); replaced with Registry Editor and Device Manager for better coverage of Windows admin tools without duplication
- **RDP scripts: instant clipboard paste** — scripts/snippets are now sent via clipboard + Ctrl+V instead of character-by-character autotype; a 2000-char script that took ~16s now executes instantly; controlled by `script_paste_via_clipboard` in RDP connection config (enabled by default)
- **Snippet delivery mode** — each snippet now has a "Delivery" setting (Auto / Clipboard / Autotype) allowing per-snippet control over how it's sent to the remote session; "Clipboard" is instant for large scripts, "Autotype" is reliable for Citrix or legacy consoles

### Dependencies

- **Updated**: rpassword 7.5.2→7.5.3

## [0.14.5] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **RDP Scripts v2: Shell Launchers + Autotype** — redesigned the "Scripts" dropdown in the RDP toolbar: now split into "Shell Launchers" (PowerShell, PowerShell Admin, CMD, CMD Admin — open shells via Win+R) and "Scripts" (user snippets sent via autotype into the already-open shell); removes timing hacks — the user controls when the shell is ready.
- **Snippet target platform** — snippets can now be marked as "Terminal", "Windows", or "Any"; the terminal context menu hides Windows-only snippets, and RDP sessions show only Windows-compatible ones

### Improved

- **Edit Group dialog redesigned** — the single-page Edit Group form is now split into 5 tabs: Identity, SSH Inheritance, Cloud Sync, Dynamic Folder, and Automation; Cloud Sync tab auto-hides for non-root groups
- **Connection dialog adapts to narrow windows** — the New/Edit Connection dialog now responds to window width and keeps content readable on small screens
- **Connection Wizard: Security Key (FIDO2)** — added "Security Key (FIDO2)" authentication option in the wizard for SSH, Mosh, and SFTP protocols
- **Connection Wizard: back navigation** — each wizard page now has its own header bar with a back button (GNOME HIG); dialog height increased to reduce scrolling
- **Redundant Cancel buttons removed** — dialogs that already close on Escape no longer show a separate Cancel button (password, document, snippet variable dialogs)
- **Color scheme selector modernized** — the Light/Dark/System toggle in Settings now uses the native libadwaita toggle group widget (or a combo row on older versions)
- **Dialog sizes unified** — all dialogs now use consistent dimensions; fixed minimum-size warnings on some screens
- **All dialogs migrated to modern adaptive style** — 25+ dialogs (Connection, Snippets, Templates, Clusters, Recordings, Import, Export, Statistics, Variables, Smart Folder, Password Generator, Sessions, Shortcuts, Terminal Search, Documents, Groups, SSH Agent passphrase) now support bottom-sheet on narrow screens, close on Escape, and drag-to-close
- **`--window-mode` CLI flag scoped to RDP/VNC/SPICE** — using `--window-mode` with protocols that don't support it (SSH, Telnet, etc.) now shows a warning instead of silently ignoring the value; SPICE added to supported protocols
- **SSH Agent passphrase no longer written to disk** — the askpass helper now passes the passphrase via an environment variable instead of a temporary file; safe on copy-on-write filesystems (btrfs, APFS, ZFS)
- **Bitwarden CLI resilience** — `--nointeraction` flag added to all `bw` commands to prevent hangs in sandboxed environments; 30-second timeout on all CLI calls; session key trusted without `bw status` verification (workaround for Bitwarden CLI v2026.4.x reporting "locked" despite valid session)

### Fixed

- **Quick Connect: user's color theme not applied ([#156](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/156))** — new connections from Quick Connect now use the configured terminal theme instead of always defaulting to "Dark"
- **Bitwarden: vault unlock not persisted across operations** — `mark_verified()` was missing after successful unlock via saved password or keyring, causing subsequent `retrieve`/`store` calls to re-check `bw status` (which incorrectly reported "locked" on Bitwarden CLI v2026.4.1); session key is now trusted immediately after unlock
- **Bitwarden: "Open Settings" button in backend-missing dialog** — fixed `ActionGroupExt` trait error; now uses `WidgetExt::activate_action` with correct `win.settings` prefix

### Dependencies

- `js-sys` 0.3.98 → 0.3.99
- `wasm-bindgen` 0.2.121 → 0.2.122
- `wasm-bindgen-futures` 0.4.71 → 0.4.72
- `wasm-bindgen-macro` 0.2.121 → 0.2.122
- `web-sys` 0.3.98 → 0.3.99

## [0.14.4] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **CLI: `history`, `pin`/`unpin`, `tag`, `move`, `monitor` commands** — full set of connection management commands (history, favorites, tags, group moves, monitoring)
- **CLI: `import --auto` / `--dry-run`** — auto-detect sources (Asbru, Remmina, SSH config) and preview imports without saving
- **CLI: `export --csv-delimiter`, `--csv-fields`** — customize CSV export format
- **CLI: `add`/`update` — full GUI parity** — all advanced fields for SSH, RDP, VNC, SPICE, MOSH, Serial; metadata (`--tags`, `--group`, `--domain`, `--skip-port-check`)
- **Config file locking** — exclusive advisory lock (`fs2`) on write; GUI + CLI no longer conflict
- **SSH agent: `add_key()` accepts `&SecretString`** — intermediate strings wrapped in `Zeroizing`
- **Quick Connect: history persisted across sessions** — up to 15 entries in `config.toml`, no passwords
- **RDP Quick Actions: 3 new Windows admin tools** — Disk Management (`diskmgmt.msc`), Resource Monitor (`resmon`), Computer Management (`compmgmt.msc`); 9 total actions in the "⋮" menu

### Fixed

- **Settings: Azure/gcloud/OCI CLI not detected in Flatpak** — relevant env vars now passed through
- **Settings: `.version` file fallback** for CLI tools installed via Components dialog
- **Settings: SSH/RDP/Waypipe version strings** — parser now extracts version token only
- **Command Palette: "New Group"** — fixed shortcut display Ctrl+Shift+N → Ctrl+Shift+G

### Improved

- **Pre-connect probe bypass: cleanup** — replaced inline checks with `conn.bypasses_direct_probe()`
- **Property tests: +8 tests** in `connection_probe_tests.rs` (VNC/SPICE/RDP/SFTP jump_host, invariant)
- **vault_ops: deduplicated `collect_descendant_groups`** — replaced O(n²) recursive local function with `rustconn_core::models::collect_descendant_group_ids()` (O(n) BFS with parent→children index)

### Dependencies

- `fs2` 0.4 (new — advisory file locking)
- `either` 1.15.0 → 1.16.0


## [0.14.3] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Settings: removed duplicate group titles above collapsible sections** — `PreferencesGroup` title was visually duplicated with the `ExpanderRow` title for System Tray, Session Restore, Logging, and Highlight Rules sections; removed the redundant group-level titles per GNOME HIG (ExpanderRow already carries the section label)
- **CLI: `secret set --password` wrapped in `Zeroizing` immediately** — the plain `String` from argv is now wrapped in `zeroize::Zeroizing` as soon as clap parses it, minimizing heap lifetime; intermediate strings before `SecretString::from()` are zeroed on drop; added `--password-stdin` flag as the recommended secure alternative (reads one line from stdin pipe, never appears in `/proc/cmdline`); `--password` is deprecated with a runtime warning 

### Improved

- **External window: migrated to libadwaita** — `external_window.rs` now uses `adw::ApplicationWindow` + `adw::ToolbarView` + `adw::HeaderBar` instead of plain `gtk4::ApplicationWindow` + `gtk4::HeaderBar`; consistent with the rest of the application, inherits Adwaita styling and color scheme support
- **Settings: collapsible sections (GNOME HIG)** — wrapped secondary settings groups into `AdwExpanderRow` to reduce visual clutter on overloaded pages; collapsed by default, users expand only what they need:
  - Terminal tab: Logging section (7 controls) collapsed into a single "Session Logging" expander
  - Interface tab: System Tray (2 controls) and Session Restore (3 controls) collapsed into expanders
  - Interface tab: Keybindings — each category (Terminal, Navigation, Tabs, etc.) is now a collapsible expander inside a single "Keyboard Shortcuts" group instead of separate full-width groups
  - Highlight Rules already used an expander (unchanged)
- **Edit Connection: collapsible sections (GNOME HIG)** — wrapped secondary settings groups in the connection dialog into `AdwExpanderRow` to reduce visual clutter:
  - Advanced tab: Terminal Theme, Activity Monitor, Automatic Reconnection, Highlight Rules, and Wake On LAN collapsed into expanders; Remote Monitoring, Session Recording, and Connection Behavior remain as single-toggle groups
  - Automation tab: Pattern Tester, Pre-Connect Task, and Post-Disconnect Task collapsed into expanders; Expect Rules list remains expanded as the primary function
- **Settings: credential storage as a 3-state ComboRow** — replaced the per-backend pair of "Save password" + "Save to system keyring" CheckButtons (with hand-rolled mutual-exclusion logic) with a single `AdwComboRow` offering three canonical choices: "Don't save" / "Encrypted file (machine-specific)" / "System keyring (recommended)". Applies to all four secret backends: KeePassXC database password, Bitwarden master password, 1Password service-account token, and Passbolt GPG passphrase. Settings storage layout is unchanged — the previous `*_password_encrypted` and `*_save_to_keyring` fields are retained as the persistence sink, with a `CredentialStorage` enum and `*_storage()` / `set_*_storage()` helpers in `rustconn-core` providing the canonical API. Old configs round-trip through the new selector without a migration step
- **Settings UI: GNOME HIG compliance** — converted 25 toggle controls from `CheckButton`-in-`AdwActionRow` pattern to `AdwSwitchRow` across Interface, Terminal, Logging, and Monitoring pages; switches are the canonical libadwaita widget for boolean preferences and provide better touch targets, larger hit areas, and consistent rendering across themes; no behavioural changes 
  - Interface tab: 7 toggles (Color tabs by protocol, Show protocol filters, Remember size, Show tray icon, Minimize to tray, Session restore Enabled, Ask first)
  - Terminal tab: 8 toggles (Scroll on output / keystroke, Scrollbar, Hyperlinks, Hide pointer, Bell, SFTP via mc, Copy on select)
  - Logging tab: 4 toggles (Activity, User Input, Terminal Output, Timestamps)
  - Monitoring tab: 6 toggles (CPU / Memory / Disk / Network / Load / System info usage)
- **Settings dialog field types unified** — internal `SettingsDialog` struct fields renamed/retyped from `gtk4::CheckButton` to `adw::SwitchRow` for the migrated controls

### Dependencies
- `pastey` 0.2.2 → 0.2.3

## [0.14.2] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **Centralized pre-connect probe bypass** — `Connection::bypasses_direct_probe()` and `Connection::should_pre_connect_check()` in `rustconn-core`; single source of truth for jump host, RDP Gateway, SSH ProxyCommand, and SPICE proxy detection; replaces 5+ scattered inline checks; SPICE proxy now correctly skips port check (previously missed)
- **Auto-reconnect: attempt N/M in banner** — "Auto-reconnecting (attempt 2/5)" with live updates via background→UI channel

### Fixed

- **CLI: `add --protocol web` port always 0** — Web branch now uses resolved port (default 443 or `--port`)
- **CLI: SecureCRT export/import missing** — added `secure-crt` format to both `ExportFormatArg` and `ImportFormatArg`
- **CSV import: silent port overflow** — values > 65535 or 0 now skip the row with a warning instead of silently using default
- **Credential memory: backend passwords as plain String** — `get_bw_password_from_keyring()` and 3 similar functions now return `SecretString` directly
- **Tooltip: "New Group (Ctrl+Shift+N)"** — corrected to actual shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G

### Improved

- **i18n: 15 new translatable strings** — connection dialog validation (10), "Ctrl+Alt+Del" button, AlertDialog "OK", search syntax help popover (6 lines), auto-reconnect attempt progress
- **Documentation: CLI_REFERENCE.md** — version header updated to 0.14.2

### Dependencies
- `asn1-rs` 0.7.1 → 0.7.2
- `num-conv` 0.2.1 → 0.2.2
- `tar` 0.4.45 → 0.4.46
- `tower-http` 0.6.10 → 0.6.11

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Predefined connection templates** — 20 built-in templates for common CLI tools (RustDesk, Docker, Podman, LXC, Incus, Distrobox, Virsh, Proxmox, IPMI, Picocom, WireGuard, Teleport, Ansible, and more) with emoji icons, grouped into 6 categories: Remote Desktop, Containers, Virtualization, Hardware, Cloud Access, Automation
- **Template grid in Connection Wizard** — Custom Command mode (Step 2) now shows a grid of template buttons below the command field; user ZeroTrust templates appear first, predefined fill remaining slots; "More…" button opens a popover with all templates grouped by category
- **Template icon field** — templates now support a custom icon (emoji or GTK icon name); shown in Manage Templates list and inherited by connections created from the template
- **Icon inheritance** — connections created via wizard template buttons automatically inherit the template's emoji icon for sidebar display
- **Per-connection "Skip port check" toggle** — new switch in the Advanced tab → Connection Behavior section to bypass the pre-connect TCP probe for the selected connection; useful for low-bandwidth links and hosts only reachable through an RDP Gateway or jump host (#153)

### Fixed

- **"Use Template" freezes UI** — clicking "Use Template" in the template manager opened the new-connection dialog as a modal child of the manager window, which was immediately closed; the orphaned modal blocked all input. The dialog is now parented to the main application window (#155)
- **RDP Gateway: "Host unreachable" before connection** — the pre-connect port check probed the target RDP host directly even when an RDP Gateway was configured, so connections through corporate gateways always failed with "Connection failed. Host unreachable.". The check is now skipped automatically when `RdpConfig.gateway` is set, mirroring the existing jump-host behaviour, so FreeRDP can route via `/g:gateway:443` as expected (#153)
- **Highlight overlay: colored underlines persisted after `clear`** — overlay was reading rows from absolute buffer position 0 instead of the visible viewport, so after `clear` (which pushes the previous screen into scrollback) the overlay re-rendered highlights from the now-hidden scrollback lines on top of the cleared viewport pixels; fixed by anchoring the read range to `vadjustment.value()` (#154)

### Dependencies
- **Updated (Flatpak)**: vte 0.80.3→0.80.5, freerdp 3.25.0→3.26.0

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Connection Wizard (Ctrl+N)** — new step-by-step dialog for creating connections; 3 steps: protocol selection → connection details → authentication/finish; all 11 protocols supported; "Advanced…" escape hatch on every step opens the full ConnectionDialog; "Save" and "Save & Connect" final actions (#0140)
  - **Step 1: 4-column protocol grid** — protocols grouped into Secure Shell, Remote Desktop, Terminal, Other columns with icon + label + descriptive subtitle for each protocol
  - **Step 2: Adaptive fields** — form adapts per protocol (host/port/username for SSH, device/baud for Serial, pod/namespace for Kubernetes, provider fields for Zero Trust, URL for Web)
  - **Step 3: Auth + Appearance** — SSH auth method selection (password/key/agent), VTE color profile for terminal protocols, connection icon
  - **Jump Host** — SSH tunnel dropdown on Step 2 for SSH, MOSH, SFTP, RDP, VNC, SPICE
  - **VTE Color Profile** — terminal theme selector on Step 3 for VTE-based protocols; maps to per-connection `ConnectionThemeOverride`
  - **Wizard → Advanced pre-fill** — "Advanced…" transfers all entered data into the full ConnectionDialog
  - **Duplicate via Wizard** — "Duplicate via Wizard…" context menu in sidebar; pre-fills wizard from existing connection for clone & modify workflows
- **`win.new-connection-advanced` action** — opens the full ConnectionDialog directly (Ctrl+Shift+N)
- **Quick Connect runtime history** — last 15 sessions remembered during app lifetime; "Recent" section with type-ahead filtering; one-click fills protocol, host, port, username
- **Zero Trust: Custom Command shortcut** — dedicated button on Step 1 for running any CLI tool as a connection, without navigating Zero Trust provider list

### Fixed

- **Highlight overlay: colored underlines not removed by `clear`** — added `cursor-moved` signal as additional repaint trigger; `contents-changed` alone did not fire reliably for erase-display escape sequences, leaving ghost underlines until the next output (#154)
- **Wizard: Zero Trust provider fields lost** — `PartialConnection::to_connection()` now correctly maps all provider-specific fields for all 10 Zero Trust providers
- **Wizard: Mosh ssh_port ignored** — `MoshConfig::ssh_port` now populated from wizard's port field
- **Wizard: Serial baud rate defaulted to 115200** — baud rate selection (9600–460800) now correctly maps to `SerialBaudRate` enum
- **Quick Connect: port always shown in history** — now displays port only when it differs from protocol default

### Changed

- **Ctrl+N** — opens Connection Wizard instead of full ConnectionDialog
- **Wizard: `adw::Dialog`** — migrated from `adw::Window` for better focus management, bottom-sheet on narrow windows, auto close-on-Escape
- **Wizard Step 1: true 4-column layout** — horizontal columns with centered headers, equal spacing, buttons expand to fill vertical space; subtitles under each protocol for discoverability
- **Highlight Rules in Settings** — collapsed into `adw::ExpanderRow`, hidden by default
- **`build_zt_provider_config` refactored** — moved to `ZeroTrustProviderConfig::from_wizard_fields()` in `rustconn-core`; signature uses `Option<&str>` instead of `&Option<String>`

### Improved

- **Web protocol: URL validation** — "Next" disabled until valid URL entered; red border on invalid input


## [0.13.17] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Web bookmark connections** — new protocol type "Web" for storing website URLs with credentials; opens in the default browser via GTK4 UriLauncher (portal-aware, works in Flatpak); credentials stored in the configured secret backend (KeePassXC, Bitwarden, etc.) for copy-to-clipboard via context menu; no embedded browser — delegates to the system default; icon `web-browser-symbolic` in sidebar (#151)
- **RDP RemoteApp support** — launch individual remote applications instead of a full desktop session; configure program path, arguments, and display name in the connection dialog; automatically uses FreeRDP (IronRDP does not support RAIL protocol); imported from `.rdp` files (`remoteapplicationprogram`, `remoteapplicationcmdline`, `remoteapplicationname` fields) (#153)

### Fixed

- **Cloud Sync in Flatpak** — detect XDG Document Portal paths when selecting sync directory; show a warning dialog with `flatpak override` command instead of silently saving an unusable portal path; dialog body now instructs user to adjust the path if needed (#152)
- **Highlight overlay not cleared by `clear` command** — colored underlines and background highlights now disappear immediately when the terminal screen is erased; replaced 32ms timeout throttle with idle-based redraw and added whitespace-only line filtering (#154)

### Improved

- **RDP RemoteApp: FreeRDP availability warning** — the connection dialog now shows a warning row when RemoteApp is configured but no FreeRDP binary is detected on the system, preventing a confusing error at connect time
- **Documentation: RemoteApp** — added "RemoteApp (RAIL)" section to User Guide with configuration steps, program path format table, import notes, and limitations; updated "Supported .rdp Fields" list
- **Documentation: Cloud Sync portal detection** — added note about automatic XDG Document Portal path detection to the Flatpak Cloud Sync section
- **Documentation: Highlight overlay limitation** — documented that whitespace-only lines are excluded from highlight processing

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: libbz2-rs-sys 0.2.4→0.2.5, openssl 0.10.79→0.10.80, openssl-sys 0.9.115→0.9.116

## [0.13.16] - 2026-05-16

### Added — macOS Port

First macOS release with full native support:

- **Native PTY** — VTE `spawn_async` workaround via `openpty()` + `Pty::foreign_sync()` with job control
- **Tray icon** (`tray-macos` feature) — NSStatusItem via `tray-icon` + `muda` with dynamic menu (Show/Hide, Recent, Quick Connect, Quit)
- **macOS Keychain** — native credential storage via Security.framework
- **DMG packaging** — automated build with bundled Adwaita icons, locales, GSettings schemas, ad-hoc code signing
- **Homebrew formula** — `brew tap totoshko88/rustconn && brew install rustconn`
- **PATH extension** — `.app` bundle injects Homebrew paths for CLI tool detection (KeePassXC, bw, op, etc.)
- **Platform-aware URL opener** — `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux

### Fixed — macOS

- **Tray icon** — main-thread init, Retina 44px template icon, diagnostic logging on failure
- **DMG bundle** — `cp -RL` resolves Homebrew symlinks; fixed iconset glob; wrapper exports full PATH
- **Icon theme** — `register_app_icon()` discovers bundle's `Resources/share/icons` and Homebrew paths
- **PTY** — child process cleanup (no zombies), handle race prevention via `std::mem::forget`
- **Secret detection** — unified `detection_command()` with extended PATH, removed invalid Cellar paths
- **X11 fallback** — skipped on macOS via `#[cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))]`

### Fixed — General

- **RDP error messages** — IronRDP CredSSP/NLA errors now show specific cause (invalid credentials, account locked, password expired) instead of generic "Connection failed"
- **Settings dialog width** — increased to 800px to prevent tab label truncation on localized builds
- **SFTP file manager ignores "Disable MC" setting** — in Flatpak, `is_flatpak()` override forced Midnight Commander regardless of user preference; now respects the saved `sftp_use_mc` toggle (default remains `true` in Flatpak for new installs); shows a warning toast when using external file manager in Flatpak since it cannot access the sandbox SSH agent

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: tray-icon 0.19→0.20 (fixes muda version conflict), winnow 1.0.2→1.0.3

## [0.13.15] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Local Shell: custom command** — new "Command" field in Settings → Terminal → Local Shell allows specifying a custom command to run instead of the default login shell (e.g. `fish`, `bash --norc`, `neofetch && bash`, environment setup scripts); applies only to Local Shell tabs, not remote connections

### Fixed
- **Split screen snippet execution** — snippets now execute in the focused pane of a split terminal tab instead of always targeting the first pane; uses per-session split bridge to resolve the correct focused session before sending text

### Improved
- **Dynamic snippet context menu** — when ≤5 snippets exist, they appear as individual items directly in the terminal right-click menu for one-click execution; when more than 5 exist, the previous "Execute Snippet…" picker is shown instead

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: aws-lc-rs 1.16.3→1.17.0, aws-lc-sys 0.40.0→0.41.0, kqueue-sys 1.1.1→1.1.2, kurbo 0.13.0→0.13.1

## [0.13.14] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Welcome page: Import button** — added "Import" action button alongside "New Connection" and "Quick Connect" on the welcome page, making it easier for users migrating from PuTTY, Remmina, mRemoteNG, or SecureCRT to get started
- **Template Manager: empty state** — added `adw::StatusPage` placeholder with icon and description when no templates exist, consistent with Recordings and History dialogs
- **Reconnect banner: auto-reconnect indicator** — when auto-reconnect is active, the disconnected session banner now shows "Auto-reconnecting…" status label so users know background polling is in progress

### Fixed
- **Credential memory safety** — intermediate password strings from `expose_secret().to_string()` are now wrapped in `zeroize::Zeroizing` across VNC, RDP, and document password flows; passwords are zeroed in memory on drop instead of lingering as plain `String`
- **Potential panic in resize debounce** — replaced `unwrap()` on `Instant::checked_sub()` with `unwrap_or_else` fallback in terminal resize handler (`window/mod.rs`)
- **CLI `show` command panic** — replaced `expect("json object")` with proper `let-else` error propagation in `rustconn-cli`
- **Port overflow in SecureCRT/libvirt importers** — replaced truncating `as u16` casts with `u16::try_from().ok()` fallback to default port; prevents silent corruption when imported files contain port values > 65535
- **Sync file path traversal** — added `validate_sync_filename()` that rejects absolute paths, `..` components, and directory separators in `sync_file` field; prevents writing outside the configured sync directory via crafted `.rcn` files

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: filetime 0.2.28→0.2.29, libbz2-rs-sys 0.2.3→0.2.4, open 5.3.4→5.3.5, zerofrom 0.1.7→0.1.8

## [0.13.13] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **SSH ProxyCommand support** — new "ProxyCommand" field in the SSH connection dialog allows routing connections through a custom proxy (e.g., `ncat --proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 --proxy-type socks5 %h %p` for Tor `.onion` hidden services); skips pre-connect port check when set, since the destination is only reachable through the proxy (fixes [#146](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/146))

### Fixed
- **SSH Startup Command not executing** — the startup command configured in the SSH connection dialog was never appended to the SSH invocation in the GUI terminal; now correctly passed after `user@host` so the remote shell executes it immediately after login (fixes [#147](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/147))
- **SSH ProxyCommand port format** — jump hosts with non-standard ports now correctly use `-p port user@host` instead of invalid `user@host:port` inside `ProxyCommand` (fixes [#144](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/144))
- **RDP/VNC/SPICE tunnel through nested jump hosts** — SSH tunnel now resolves the full recursive jump host chain; previously only the immediate jump host was used, causing tunnel failure when the jump host itself required another jump host to be reachable

### Improved
- **StringInterner: `HashSet` instead of `HashMap`** — reduced memory overhead by 50% per entry (key and value were identical `Arc<str>`)
- **ConfigManager: cache `ensure_config_dir()` result** — skips filesystem check after first successful call, eliminates 1 syscall per debounced save
- **ConnectionManager: `collect_descendant_groups()` O(n) instead of O(n²)** — builds parent→children index instead of scanning all groups on each iteration
- **ConnectionManager: `sort_all()` refactor** — extracted `sort_ids_by_name()` helper, removed 4× duplicated sort-by-lowercase pattern (~60 lines)
- **WolDialog: migrated to `adw::Dialog`** — better focus management, auto close-on-Escape, bottom-sheet behavior on narrow windows (GNOME HIG)

## [0.13.12] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Auto-reconnect: per-connection RetryConfig with exponential backoff** — new "Automatic Reconnection" section in the connection dialog Advanced tab; configurable retry behavior: enable/disable, max attempts (1–10), initial delay (100–30000ms), max delay (1000–120000ms); exponential backoff with 2× multiplier; `RetryConfig` serialized with `#[serde(default)]` for backward compatibility
- **Import: multi-file batch import** — new "Multiple Files (batch)" source in the Import dialog; select multiple files at once (CSV, RDP, VV, RCN, JSON, RTSZ, MobaXterm, XML, YAML); sequential import with per-file progress; `BatchImporter` for large sets (>10) with configurable batch sizes and cancellation
- **ExpectEngine: new methods for GUI integration** — `match_line()` with auto-trimming and priority; `remove_by_id(Uuid)`; `remove_expired()` and `remove_expired_individual()` for per-rule timeouts

### Improved
- **Import: success messages now use i18n_f()** for proper localization
- **AutomationSession uses ExpectEngine from core** — delegates to `ExpectEngine` for priority-sorted matching, duplicate ID detection, pattern validation, and timeout handling; `Trigger` struct removed
- **SplitView legacy UUID layer partially removed** — external consumers use `get_pane_session()` instead of `panes_ref_clone()`; `TerminalPane` reduced to `pub(crate)`; `panes_ref()`, `panes_ref_clone()` removed from public API
- **`performance/mod.rs` decomposed** — 2210-line monolith split into 10 submodules; public API unchanged
- **`cli_download.rs` decomposed** — 3391-line monolith split into 10 submodules; public API unchanged
- **MainWindow credential resolution extracted** — 9 methods (~920 lines) moved to `window/credentials.rs`
- **MainWindow session lifecycle extracted** — 5 methods (~760 lines) moved to `window/session_lifecycle.rs`; `window/mod.rs` reduced by 31%

### Fixed
- **SSH: identity key `-i` duplicated in command** — `build_command_args()` and `spawn_ssh()` both added `-i`; now deduplicated in both connect and reconnect paths
- **CSV import: panic on empty group path** — `resolve_group_path()` now returns `ImportError::InvalidEntry` instead of `expect()`
- **VNC/RDP/SPICE embedded: hangs when remote port unreachable through SSH tunnel** — `probe_tunnel_remote()` now verifies end-to-end connectivity after tunnel readiness; fails immediately with clear error instead of hanging
- **Terminal: per-connection white color displayed as grey** — `apply_theme_override_with_base()` now rebuilds full 16-color palette via `set_colors()`, replacing palette entries 7+15 and 0+8 ([#145](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/145))

### Dependencies
- `clap_complete` 4.6.4 → 4.6.5
- `kqueue-sys` 1.1.0 → 1.1.1
- `nix` 0.31.2 → 0.31.3

## [0.13.11] - 2026-05-10

### Improved
- **RDP: better diagnostics for IronRDP fallback to FreeRDP** — when the embedded IronRDP client encounters a protocol incompatibility (e.g. GNOME Remote Desktop sending unexpected PDU during capabilities exchange), the error detection now includes detailed comments explaining the upstream limitation (IronRDP connector 0.8.0 does not handle `ServerDeactivateAll` during `CapabilitiesExchange`); submitted fix upstream ([Devolutions/IronRDP#1253](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/issues/1253)); narrowed fallback detection patterns to avoid false positives on generic network errors (e.g. "unexpected end of stream" no longer triggers fallback)
- **Security: pre/post-connect tasks now use TaskExecutor from core** — pre-connect and post-disconnect automation tasks are now executed through `TaskExecutor` instead of raw `sh -c`; this adds: timeout enforcement (`timeout_ms` field is now respected — previously commands could hang indefinitely; timed-out processes are now killed instead of orphaned), environment sanitization (removes `BW_SESSION`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `OP_SESSION`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` from child process to prevent credential leakage), variable substitution (`${var}` references in task commands are now resolved from both global and connection-scoped variables — `${host}`, `${port}`, `${username}`, `${name}` are available automatically), and conditional execution (`only_first_in_folder` / `only_last_in_folder` conditions are now evaluated correctly via a shared `FolderConnectionTracker` in `AppState`)
- **UX: pre-connect task failure toast now shows error details** — instead of a generic "Pre-connect task failed. Connection aborted." message, the toast now includes the specific error (e.g. "Task timed out after 5000ms", "Task failed with exit code 1") via `i18n_f()` for proper localization
- **Code quality: ConnectionDialog decomposed** — extracted `create_rdp_options` (640 lines), `create_vnc_options` (310 lines), `create_spice_options` (290 lines), and `create_zerotrust_options` (480 lines) from the monolithic `dialog.rs` (8746 → 6968 lines, −20%) into their respective protocol modules (`rdp.rs`, `vnc.rs`, `spice.rs`, `zerotrust.rs`); replaced dead-code placeholder implementations with the actual production code; all protocol tab modules now follow the same pattern as the existing `ssh.rs`, `telnet.rs`, `serial.rs`, `kubernetes.rs`

### Removed
- **Dead code: `ConnectionFallback` module removed from rustconn-core** — the generic fallback chain (`ConnectionFallback`, `ConnectionStrategy`, `FallbackError`, `StrategyAttempt`) was never integrated into the GUI; the RDP fallback (IronRDP → wlfreerdp → xfreerdp) uses a purpose-built ad-hoc chain that is tightly coupled to GTK widget lifecycle; the generic module added complexity without benefit and can be restored from git history if needed
- **Dead code: `VirtualScrollConfig` removed from public API** — `VirtualScrollConfig` was re-exported from `rustconn-core` but never imported by any consumer (GUI or CLI); removed from `lib.rs` and `connection/mod.rs` re-exports, reduced visibility to `pub(crate)` for internal module tests only
- **UI: removed "Window Mode" section from Advanced tab** — the Display Mode dropdown (Embedded/External/Fullscreen) and Remember Position checkbox were shown for all protocols but only worked for RDP and VNC; for SSH, Telnet, SPICE, Serial, Kubernetes, and Mosh it was completely ignored; for RDP/VNC it duplicated the existing "Client Mode" setting in the Protocol tab; the `window_mode` field remains in the data model for backward compatibility but is no longer editable from the dialog ([#130](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/130))

### Dependencies
- `clap_complete` 4.6.3 → 4.6.4
- `hybrid-array` 0.4.11 → 0.4.12

## [0.13.10] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Import/Export: SecureCRT session support** — import connections from SecureCRT's `Config/Sessions/` directory (individual `.ini` files); export connections back to SecureCRT INI format as a directory tree; supports SSH2, Telnet, RDP, VNC protocols with hostname, port, username, SSH key path, X11/agent forwarding, compression; folder hierarchy preserved as connection groups; available in GUI export dialog, CLI, and programmatic API ([#140](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/140))

### Fixed
- **Backup/Restore: global variables lost after restore** — restoring settings from a ZIP archive would show "Restored N files" but closing the settings dialog afterwards overwrote the restored `config.toml` with stale in-memory state (which had empty `global_variables`); the dialog now reloads `AppSettings` from disk immediately after a successful restore so that the in-memory state matches the restored file ([#142](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/142))
- **SSH: ControlMaster sockets now actually closed on application exit** — the shutdown handler scanned `active_sessions()` to find SSH connections needing socket cleanup, but by the time GTK's `connect_shutdown` fires, all sessions are already in `Terminated` state (GTK destroys widgets first), so the list was always empty and no sockets were ever closed; replaced with a filesystem scan of the runtime directory for `rc-*` socket files, which works regardless of session state; stale sockets that don't respond to `ssh -O exit` are force-removed ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125))
- **KeePass: custom entry path for variables ignored RustConn/ prefix** — when a user specified a custom "KeePass entry" path for a secret variable, the lookup still prepended `RustConn/` and tried fallback paths, making it impossible to reference entries at arbitrary locations in the database; added `get_password_from_kdbx_exact()` that queries the entry at the exact user-specified path without any prefix or fallback logic; default (no custom path) behaviour unchanged ([#143](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/143))
- **KeePass: "Variable Not Configured" dialog loop when database password not set** — the dialog appeared on every connection because: (1) `save_variable_to_vault` silently failed when KeePass couldn't unlock the database (`kdbx_password = None`), (2) the retry always re-read from KeePass which also failed, (3) the user's backend choice in the dialog dropdown was ignored; fixed by: respecting the user-selected backend from the dialog, showing an error toast when save fails instead of silently retrying, adding LibSecret fallback for both read and write when KeePass is unavailable and `enable_fallback` is enabled; the dialog now shows only the configured preferred backend + LibSecret as options ([#143](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/143))

### Dependencies
- `hashbrown` 0.17.0 → 0.17.1

## [0.13.9] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **Flatpak: Zero Trust Generic commands now execute on host** — custom commands in the Generic Zero Trust provider were failing with "No command specified" because the double `sh -c` wrapping broke argument parsing for `flatpak-spawn`; now Generic commands in Flatpak are automatically wrapped with `flatpak-spawn --host -- script -qfc '...' /dev/null` (same PTY-allocating approach as Local Shell), so host-side binaries resolve correctly without manual `flatpak-spawn` prefixes; single quotes in command templates are properly escaped ([#132](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/132))
- **Split View: focus border not updating on click** — clicking a terminal pane in split view would send input to the correct terminal but the focus border (colored outline) remained on the previously focused pane; root cause: each call to `setup_all_panel_click_handlers` added a new `GestureClick` controller without removing the previous one, causing duplicate gesture controllers to compete for the click event; the first (stale) handler would claim the event before the current handler could update focus styling; fixed by removing existing primary-button gesture controllers before adding a new one
- **Zero Trust Generic: skip vault credential lookup** — connecting via Generic Command no longer triggers a ~14-second Bitwarden/KeePass vault lookup; the custom command handles its own authentication interactively in the terminal, so vault resolution is unnecessary and was only adding startup delay ([#132](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/132))

### Improved
- **RDP: real disk space reported to Windows via shared folders** — the RDPDR backend now queries actual filesystem statistics using `nix::sys::statvfs` instead of returning hardcoded values; Windows Explorer and applications connected via shared folders now see correct total/available disk space; values are normalized to 4096-byte allocation units matching the reported sector geometry; graceful fallback to defaults if the statvfs call fails

### Dependencies
- `cc` 1.2.61 → 1.2.62
- `filetime` 0.2.27 → 0.2.28
- `quick-xml` 0.39.3 → 0.39.4
- `tokio` 1.52.2 → 1.52.3
- Added `nix` 0.31.2 (feature: `fs`) to rustconn-core for safe statvfs access

## [0.13.8] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **Per-connection monitoring toggle not saving state** — the "Enable Monitoring" switch in the connection dialog Advanced tab always appeared enabled and did not persist the user's choice; root cause: `update_connection()` in `ConfigManager` unconditionally overwrote `monitoring_config` with the old value from the existing connection (`updated.monitoring_config = existing.monitoring_config.clone()`), discarding the user's change from the dialog; additionally, the save logic stored `None` when the toggle was ON (meaning "use global default") instead of an explicit override, so per-connection enable didn't work when global monitoring was disabled; fixed both: removed the overwrite in `update_connection`, and save now stores explicit `Some(true)` / `Some(false)` so the per-connection toggle correctly overrides the global setting in both directions ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125))
- **Flatpak: CLI tools not found by protocol detection** — `which_binary()` in protocol detection only checked `/app/bin` and system PATH; CLI tools installed via Flatpak Components (e.g. hoop, boundary, tailscale) in `~/.var/app/io.github.totoshko88.RustConn/cli/` were not discovered; now searches all `get_cli_path_dirs()` directories and passes the full resolved path to version detection
- **Hoop.dev CLI version not displayed** — `hoop version` outputs JSON (`{"version":"1.59.3",...}`) which the generic version parser did not recognize; added `parse_json_version()` to extract the version field from JSON output; also fixed `get_version()` to set extended PATH in Flatpak so the binary can be executed from its install directory

## [0.13.7] - 2026-05-08

### Improved
- **Flatpak CLI: automatic version resolution for 7 components** — Tailscale, kubectl, Teleport, Boundary, Hoop.dev, Bitwarden CLI, and 1Password CLI no longer use hardcoded version URLs; instead, the latest version is detected at install/update time from upstream APIs (Kubernetes stable.txt, GitHub releases, HashiCorp checkpoint, Tailscale packages page, Hoop latest.txt, AgileBits update API); this eliminates the need to manually bump versions in source code and ensures users always get the latest release; `scripts/check-cli-versions.sh` updated to verify endpoint reachability instead of comparing pinned versions

### Fixed
- **SSH: monitoring no longer triggers a second agent confirmation** — monitoring now waits up to 5 seconds for the main session's ControlMaster socket to appear, then connects as `ControlMaster=no` (slave only); previously monitoring used `ControlMaster=auto` which could race with the main session and create a separate master connection, causing a second Bitwarden/SSH agent prompt; falls back to creating its own master only if the socket never appears ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125))
- **SSH: ControlMaster sockets cleaned up on application exit** — all SSH ControlMaster sockets are now gracefully closed (`ssh -O exit`) when the application shuts down; previously sockets lingered in the filesystem until `ControlPersist` timeout expired ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125))
- **SSH: control socket path shortened for macOS compatibility** — the ControlPath format changed from `rustconn-ssh-{host}-{port}-%r` to `rc-{host}-{port}-%r`; on macOS, `/tmp` is used instead of `$TMPDIR` (which is ~52 chars under `/var/folders/...`) to stay within the 104-byte Unix socket path limit; long hostnames are truncated to 40 characters with `floor_char_boundary` for UTF-8 safety
- **Auto-reconnect: no longer loops infinitely on rapid crashes** — if a session crashes within 5 seconds of starting (e.g., SIGSEGV in VTE), auto-reconnect is skipped to prevent an infinite reconnect loop; previously a terminal crash would trigger immediate reconnect → crash → reconnect indefinitely at ~17ms intervals
- **Flatpak: local shell PTY resize now propagates to host** — when the VTE widget resizes, the new dimensions are forwarded to the host-side PTY via `flatpak-spawn --host -- stty rows R cols C` with 200ms debounce; previously the host shell retained its initial 24×80 size regardless of window resizing, causing incorrect line wrapping in bash, vim, htop, etc. ([#122](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/122))
- **Shutdown: socket cleanup limited to active sessions only** — previously attempted to close ControlMaster sockets for all saved SSH connections; now only closes sockets for sessions that were actually connected, using `futures::join_all` for parallel execution

## [0.13.6] - 2026-05-07

### Improved
- **Preferences: Monitoring moved to its own page** — monitoring settings (global enable, polling interval, visible metrics, activity monitor) are now on a dedicated "Monitoring" tab with the `utilities-system-monitor-symbolic` icon instead of being buried at the bottom of the Connection page; the subtitle on the global enable switch now clarifies that per-connection overrides are configured in the Advanced tab of the connection dialog ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125))
- **CLI: machine-readable output for AI agents and scripting** — `show`, `test`, and `stats` commands now accept `--format json|csv|table`; `group show` also supports `--format`; all default to JSON when stdout is piped (non-TTY); `list --format json` output now includes `description`, `group_id`, `tags`, `last_connected` fields; `test --format json` returns structured results with `latency_ms`, `pass_rate`, and per-connection details; `stats --format json` returns all metrics as a single JSON object; `group show --format json` includes child groups and connections list ([#132](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/132))
- **i18n: activity monitor mode and export format names now translatable** — `MonitorMode::display_name()` values ("Off", "Activity", "Silence") and `ExportFormat::display_name()` values ("Ansible Inventory", "SSH Config", etc.) are now wrapped in `i18n()` at call sites so they appear translated in the UI; previously these were hardcoded English strings passed as arguments to `i18n_f()` without translation
- **Security: intermediate password strings now zeroized on drop** — cached RDP/VNC credentials extracted via `expose_secret().to_string()` are now wrapped in `zeroize::Zeroizing<String>` so the plaintext is overwritten in memory when the variable goes out of scope; previously these intermediate `String` copies remained in heap memory until the allocator reused the page
- **Reliability: host check no longer panics on runtime creation failure** — `tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().expect()` in WoL/reconnect polling replaced with proper `Result` propagation via a new `HostCheckError::Io` variant; if the tokio runtime cannot be created (e.g. file descriptor exhaustion), the error is reported gracefully instead of crashing

### Fixed
- **SSH: single authentication prompt for connection + monitoring** — the main VTE terminal SSH connection now always uses `ControlMaster=auto` with a shared `ControlPath`; the monitoring subsystem reuses the same socket instead of opening a separate SSH session, eliminating the second key/passphrase/agent prompt that previously appeared when monitoring started; if the user already enabled ControlMaster manually in connection settings, the shared ControlPath is still injected so monitoring can find the socket ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125))
- **Repository hygiene: removed committed vim swap file and msgmerge backups** — `rustconn-core/src/.ssh_tunnel.rs.swp` removed from git tracking; `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*.po~` patterns added to `.gitignore` to prevent future accidental commits

## [0.13.5] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Drag & Drop file paths into VTE terminals (SSH/Telnet)** — dragging files from a file manager onto a terminal session inserts their shell-escaped paths (single-quoted with `'\''` for embedded quotes), separated by spaces; matches GNOME Terminal behavior; visual highlight on the terminal when dragging over it; works with multiple files simultaneously ([#74](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/74))
- **Drag & Drop files to RDP clipboard (embedded IronRDP)** — dragging files onto an embedded RDP session announces them to the remote server via the CLIPRDR `FileGroupDescriptorW` channel (`CF_HDROP`); the server can then paste the files as if they were copied locally; includes a circuit breaker that auto-disables after 3 consecutive failures with an `adw::Toast` notification and "Try Again" button to re-enable; servers that don't support `STREAM_FILECLIP_ENABLED` are detected at capability negotiation and the feature is disabled gracefully ([#74](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/74))
- **RDP: "Reconnect on Resize" option** — new checkbox in the RDP connection dialog (Advanced → Features) that forces a full reconnect on window resize instead of using the Display Control Channel; useful for legacy RDP servers (Windows Server 2008/2012) that don't support MS-RDPEDISP, or when the server ignores dynamic resolution changes; disabled by default (dynamic resize is preferred)
- **Smart Folders: custom emoji icons** — smart folders now support a custom emoji icon displayed in the sidebar instead of the default 📁; set via the "Icon" field in the New/Edit Smart Folder dialog or `--icon` CLI flag (`rustconn-cli smart-folder create --icon "🚀"`); use "none" to clear in edit mode; the emoji is persisted in settings and shown in the sidebar folder row ([#133](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/133))

### Fixed
- **RDP: automatic reconnect on resize for servers without Display Control Channel** — when the server does not support MS-RDPEDISP (e.g. Windows Server 2008/2012/2016 without the Display Control extension), RustConn now automatically falls back to a full reconnect with the new resolution instead of leaving the session at the old resolution with distorted scaling; previously, if "Reconnect on Resize" was unchecked, the resize was silently ignored for such servers; now the dynamic resize path is always attempted first, and if the server reports Display Control unavailable, a reconnect is triggered regardless of the checkbox state; the "Reconnect on Resize" option now means "always reconnect immediately without trying dynamic resize first" — useful when you know the server doesn't support it and want to skip the initial attempt ([#131](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/131))
- **RDP: Copy/Paste toolbar buttons don't actually copy or paste** — the Copy button set the local GTK clipboard but didn't suppress the `clipboard-changed` handler, causing a feedback loop that re-announced the same text back to the server; the Paste button only updated the server's clipboard buffer via CLIPRDR `FormatList` but never simulated Ctrl+V, so text was never actually pasted into the active remote window; fixed: Copy now suppresses the sync handler for 100ms to prevent the feedback loop; Paste now sends `SendKeySequence` (Ctrl+V) after a 150ms delay to let the server process the clipboard data before pasting ([#126](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/126))
- **RDP: dynamic resize without reconnect via Display Control Channel** — window resize no longer triggers a full session disconnect/reconnect cycle; instead, the new resolution is sent in-place via the MS-RDPEDISP Display Control Virtual Channel (`SetDesktopSize` → `encode_resize`), which is the same mechanism used by mstsc, xfreerdp, and Remmina; the session continues seamlessly with the server-side desktop resized to match the new widget dimensions; debounce (500ms) and threshold (50px) remain to avoid flooding the server with resize requests; FreeRDP external mode still falls back to reconnect since it has no DVC access from the widget side ([#131](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/131))
- **SSH agent key selection not remembered in connection dialog** — when editing a saved connection that uses SSH agent authentication, the previously selected key was always reset to the first entry in the dropdown; root cause: `set_connection()` tried to restore the key selection before `refresh_agent_keys()` loaded the key list, then `refresh_agent_keys()` unconditionally reset the dropdown to index 0; now the selected fingerprint/comment is stored as a pending selection and restored after the agent keys are loaded ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125))
- **SSH agent: multiple authentication prompts from monitoring** — the monitoring subsystem spawned a new SSH process every 3 seconds to collect metrics, each requiring a separate SSH agent confirmation (e.g., Bitwarden desktop app); now monitoring uses `ControlMaster=auto` with `ControlPersist=30` so all polling commands multiplex over a single authenticated SSH connection; the agent is only prompted once when monitoring starts ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125), [#135](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/135))
- **Smart Folders: double-click and context menu not working for connections** — connections inside smart folders did not respond to double-click (connect) or right-click (context menu); root cause: the inner `ListBox` used `SelectionMode::None` which blocked `row_activated` signal, and the `connect-to` window action was never registered; fixed by switching to `SelectionMode::Single` with `activate_on_single_click(false)`, registering a new `win.connect-to` action that accepts a connection ID parameter, and adding a right-click context menu on connection rows with Connect, Edit, Copy Username/Password, Wake On LAN, Check if Online, and Delete actions
- **Toast error messages showing only "Error" without details** — the retry toast for port check failures (SSH, VNC, SPICE, Telnet, MOSH) displayed only a generic "Error" icon+label with no message text; root cause: `set_custom_title()` replaces the entire toast title widget, so the message passed to `Toast::new()` was never rendered; fixed by including the message in the custom title widget (format: "Error: <message>"); also replaced the generic "Connection failed. Host unreachable." text with the actual `PortCheckError` details (e.g. "Port 22 on '12.23.34.45' is not reachable: connection timed out")

## [0.13.4] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **RDP Autotype: send text as keystrokes bypassing clipboard restrictions** — new "Type Clipboard" and "Type Text…" toolbar buttons in embedded RDP sessions; sends text character-by-character using `TS_UNICODE_KEYBOARD_EVENT` PDU which is keyboard-layout independent (works regardless of DE/US/other layout mismatches); solves scenarios where server-side paste is blocked by GPO, Citrix policy, UAC dialogs, or password fields that reject Ctrl+V; "Type Clipboard" reads the local clipboard and types it into the remote session; "Type Text…" opens a dialog where the user enters text (with optional password mode) that never touches the system clipboard — ideal for sensitive strings; per-connection configurable timing: inter-character delay (5–200ms, default 20ms) and initial delay before typing starts (0–5000ms, default 0ms); higher delays needed for Citrix gateways that drop characters when events arrive too fast; iterates by Unicode grapheme clusters so composed characters (é, ñ) are sent as single units; only available for embedded IronRDP mode (external FreeRDP runs in a separate process where keystroke injection is not possible) ([#127](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/127))
- **KeePass custom entry path for secret variables** — secret variables can now reference an existing entry in the KeePass database instead of the default `RustConn/rustconn/var/{name}` path; in the Variables dialog (Menu → Tools → Variables), when a variable is marked as Secret and the KeePass backend is active, a new "KeePass entry" field appears where you can specify the full path to an existing entry (e.g., `Internet/MyRouter` or `Network/Switches/RADIUS`); the password is read directly from that entry's Password attribute — no need to duplicate secrets under the RustConn hierarchy; when a custom path is set, RustConn does not attempt to create or overwrite the entry on save ([#114](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/114))

### Fixed
- **RDP toolbar Copy/Paste buttons do nothing on Wayland (COSMIC, GNOME)** — the clipboard buttons used `drawing_area.display().clipboard()` which on Wayland may not have clipboard ownership because the clipboard is tied to the focused surface; replaced with `root().native().display().clipboard()` which uses the top-level window surface — the reliable clipboard owner on all Wayland compositors; also fixed: Paste button silently swallowed errors when local clipboard was empty or unreadable (now shows status feedback: "Local clipboard is empty" / "Cannot read clipboard" / "Clipboard channel not ready"); CLIPRDR `client_capabilities` now advertises `USE_LONG_FORMAT_NAMES` flag required by Windows Server 2016+ for proper format list exchange — without it some servers never announce clipboard formats, making the Copy button permanently disabled; added tracing for all clipboard button operations to aid future debugging ([#126](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/126))

### Dependencies
- unicode-segmentation 1.13.2 (new)
- tower-http 0.6.8 → 0.6.9

## [0.13.3] - 2026-05-05

### Improved
- **GNOME HIG: application menu restructured** — "Fullscreen" (F11) added to the app menu; monolithic Tools section (11 items) split into three logical subsections: Managers (Snippets, Clusters, Templates, Variables), Monitoring & History (Sessions, History, Statistics, Recordings), Security & Network (Password Generator, Wake On LAN, SSH Tunnels); Settings separated from Shortcuts/About/Quit into its own section per HIG convention; "About" renamed to "About RustConn" per GNOME HIG naming pattern
- **GNOME HIG: Fullscreen menu item is now stateful** — the "Fullscreen" entry in the app menu uses a stateful `GAction` so GNOME Shell displays a checkmark (✓) when fullscreen is active; previously the menu item gave no visual indication of the current state
- **GNOME HIG: manager dialogs unified** — all dialog windows now use standard window close buttons (×) instead of text "Close"/"Cancel" buttons; action buttons moved to consistent positions: primary actions as icon buttons on the left of header bar (Add `+`, Refresh, Copy, Reset, Test, Connect, Import), save/submit actions on the right (Save, Create, Export, Import, Send, Rename); Snippets manager replaced bottom text buttons with inline icon buttons per row (▶ ✏ 🗑); Templates moved "Use Template" to bottom action bar; Variables added `+` and Save to bottom; History moved "Connect" to bottom right; Connection dialog uses Test icon (`network-transmit-receive-symbolic`) on the left; Quick Connect uses Connect icon on the left; Statistics uses Reset icon (`edit-clear-all-symbolic`); Password Generator uses Copy icon; Log Viewer and Terminal Search now use standard × close; applies to: Snippets, Clusters, Templates, Variables, Sessions, History, Statistics, Recordings, Quick Connect, Password Generator, Wake On LAN, Import, Export, Group Edit, New Group, Smart Folder, Connection Dialog, Rename, Log Viewer, Terminal Search
- **GNOME HIG: RDP Security Layer dropdown accessibility** — added `accessible::Property::Label` to the Security Layer dropdown in the RDP connection dialog for screen reader support
- **Tray menu i18n** — all system tray menu strings ("Show Window", "Hide Window", "Quick Connect...", "Recent Connections", "Local Shell", "Active Session(s)", "About RustConn", "Quit", tooltip) now use `gettext()` for translation; translations provided for all 16 languages; previously hardcoded in English

### Added
- **RDP Security Layer / TLS Compatibility options** — new "Security Layer" dropdown (Negotiate/RDP/TLS/NLA) and "TLS Security Level" spin (0–5) in the RDP connection dialog; enables connections to legacy servers (Windows Server 2012 / Windows 7) that require lower TLS levels or RDP Security Layer instead of NLA; when RDP or TLS security layer is selected (or TLS level < 2), IronRDP embedded mode automatically falls back to external FreeRDP which supports legacy protocols; TLS level row is shown only when RDP or TLS mode is selected; CLI `show` command displays non-default security settings ([#124](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/124))

### Fixed
- **SSH agent: multiple authentication prompts for saved connections** — when a saved connection uses `SshKeySource::Agent` and the key comment contains a file path, `build_command_args()` previously added `-i <path> -o IdentitiesOnly=yes`; this caused SSH to first attempt file-based auth (triggering an agent confirmation in Bitwarden), then fall back to agent auth (triggering a second confirmation); fixed by removing `-i` and `IdentitiesOnly` for Agent auth entirely — the agent now offers keys naturally with a single prompt, matching Quick Connect behavior ([#125](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/125))
- **AdwTabOverview "exceeds AdwApplicationWindow size" warning in Flatpak** — embedded RDP and VNC sessions caused `AdwTabOverview` to request more space than the window provides (e.g. 1540×865 vs 1200×800 available); the RDP `DrawingArea` had no size constraint and the VNC `DrawingArea` set `content_width(1280)`/`content_height(720)` which GTK reported as natural size; fixed by setting `content_width`/`content_height` to 0 on both drawing areas (they expand via `hexpand`/`vexpand` instead) and setting `overflow: hidden` on the `TabOverview` widget
- **False "KeePassXc backend unavailable" toast when KeePassXc is running** — `check_secret_backend_available` checked `SecretManager.is_available()` for all non-LibSecret backends, but `build_from_settings` registers `LibSecretBackend` (not `KeePassXcBackend`) for KeePassXc/KdbxFile because KDBX credentials are resolved via direct file access in `resolve_credentials_blocking`; the availability probe therefore tested whether `secret-tool` could be spawned within a 5-second `block_on` timeout — which can fail in Flatpak sandboxes or when D-Bus is slow at startup — and incorrectly reported KeePassXc as unavailable; now KeePassXc/KdbxFile availability is determined by checking `kdbx_enabled && kdbx_path.exists()` instead of probing the unrelated LibSecretBackend ([#123](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/123))
- **Flatpak Local Shell: "no job control" warnings and broken PTY** — `flatpak-spawn --host` only forwards stdio without creating a host-side PTY, so the shell cannot become a session leader — causing `tcgetpgrp failed`, `setpgid: Inappropriate ioctl for device` warnings and broken job control (Ctrl-Z, fg, bg); now wraps the host shell in `script -qfc` (util-linux) which allocates a real PTY on the host, giving bash/zsh/fish a proper controlling terminal ([#122](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/122))

## [0.13.2] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Mouse scroll not working in terminal sessions** — `set_enable_fallback_scrolling(false)` was incorrectly tied to the "Mouse passthrough" setting, which disabled VTE's scrollback scrolling for normal shell sessions (bash, zsh); VTE natively forwards scroll events to programs that request mouse tracking regardless of this flag — disabling it only broke scrollback for programs without mouse tracking; now always enabled ([#121](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/121))
- **Flatpak local shell provides only a sandboxed minimal shell** — "Local Shell" in Flatpak now spawns the user's host shell via `flatpak-spawn --host` with `--login`, giving full access to system tools, dotfiles, and home directory; added `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak` permission to both Flatpak manifests ([#122](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/122))

### Removed
- **"Mouse passthrough" setting removed from Terminal preferences** — the toggle was based on a misunderstanding of VTE's `enable_fallback_scrolling` API; VTE handles mouse event forwarding to terminal apps (mc, vim, htop) automatically via escape sequences — no user-facing setting is needed; removed field from `TerminalSettings`, checkbox from UI, and obsoleted translations in all 16 languages

### Added
- **Per-connection monitoring toggle in connection dialog** — Advanced tab now has a "Remote Monitoring" section with an "Enable Monitoring" switch; when disabled, the monitoring collector does not open a separate SSH session to the remote host, preventing IP bans on devices with concurrent session limits (e.g. network routers); uses the existing `MonitoringConfig` backend — the toggle was already supported in `rustconn-core` but had no GUI ([#106](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/106))

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Crash when typing in sidebar search field** — `SearchEngine::find_case_insensitive` used raw byte-position iteration (`0..=len`) and direct byte slicing (`haystack[i..i+n]`) which panics when connection names or hosts contain multi-byte UTF-8 characters (Cyrillic, CJK, emoji, etc.); the same byte-boundary bug existed in `fuzzy_score_case_insensitive` and `fuzzy_score_optimized` prefix checks; fixed by iterating only over valid `char_indices()` boundaries and using `str::get()` for safe slicing with `is_char_boundary()` guards ([#116](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/116))
- **Export/re-import loses folder hierarchy, icons, SSH settings, and smart folders** — native `.rcn` export/import had four data-loss bugs: (1) group hierarchy flattened because binary root-vs-child sort didn't guarantee parents were created before children — replaced with topological sort; (2) folder icons (emoji), description, SSH auth settings (`ssh_auth_method`, `ssh_key_path`, `ssh_proxy_jump`, `ssh_agent_socket`), login defaults (`username`, `domain`, `password_source`), automation (`expect_rules`, `post_login_scripts`), and `dynamic_folder` config were silently dropped because `create_group_with_parent` only sets name+parent — now copies all fields via `update_group` after creation; (3) smart folders were not included in the export format at all — added `smart_folders` field to `NativeExport` (format version 3, backward-compatible via `#[serde(default)]`); (4) smart folder `filter_group_id` references were not remapped to new group UUIDs — now remapped during import; CLI export/import updated accordingly ([#118](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/118))
- **Settings dialog loses Passbolt, 1Password, Pass, and KeePassXC keyring settings on save** — the close handler used dummy widgets for 9 secret backend fields (passbolt passphrase/URL/save-to-keyring, 1password token/save-to-keyring, pass store dir, kdbx save-to-keyring); replaced with clones of real widgets so all secret backend settings are now correctly persisted
- **Statistics Reset button had no confirmation dialog** — destructive action now requires confirmation via `adw::AlertDialog`
- **Cluster and Template delete had no confirmation dialog** — both now show `adw::AlertDialog` before deletion
- **Template protocol filter dropdown was not connected** — filter now correctly filters templates by SSH/RDP/VNC/SPICE

### Improved
- **GNOME HIG compliance audit across all menu-accessible dialogs** — comprehensive review and fixes: empty states with `adw::StatusPage` (History, Statistics, Sessions, Recordings); accessible labels on status icons (History); search/filter in Recordings dialog; auto-refresh after recording import; confirmation dialogs for all destructive actions; "Add Variable" button style corrected (`suggested-action` → `flat`); Template header button renamed to "Use Template" for clarity; duplicate close buttons removed (Snippets manager); xgettext marker functions for indirect `i18n()` strings (dialog buttons, keyboard shortcuts); WoL dialog auto-sized to content; Export dialog height increased to fit all fields; Sessions window enlarged for StatusPage; copy-to-clipboard toast in Password Generator

### Documentation
- **Remmina Flatpak import troubleshooting** — added instructions to User Guide for importing Remmina connections when both apps are Flatpaks; covers `flatpak override`, Flatseal, and symlink workarounds ([#120](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/120))

### Added
- **Automation section in group edit dialog** — Expect Rules and Post-login Scripts can now be configured directly in the group edit dialog (Edit Group → Automation); full rule editor with pattern/response fields, priority/timeout controls, enabled/one-shot checkboxes, ↑↓🗑️ action buttons per rule, "Insert Variable" (➕) popover for `${password}`, `${username}`, `${host}`, `${port}`, `\n` insertion, "From Template" menu with 5 built-in presets marked with protocol hints (e.g., "Sudo Password (SSH)"), "Clear All" button, collapsible Pattern Tester for real-time rule matching, post-login scripts as individual entries with per-row delete, confirmation dialog on automation disable, stable window width via `set_size_request` + `tightening_threshold` matching Clamp, overlay scrolling to prevent layout shifts; CLI: `group edit --add-expect-rule` (JSON), `--clear-expect-rules`, `--add-post-login-script`, `--clear-post-login-scripts`; `group show` now displays automation config ([#117](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/117))

### Improved
- **Connection dialog Automation tab unified with group dialog** — expect rule editor now uses the same vertical layout as the group dialog: ↑↓🗑️ action buttons at top-right of each rule, "Insert Variable" (➕) popover on Response field, template picker with "(SSH)" protocol hints, variable substitution info banner, removed inner ScrolledWindow (scroll-in-scroll anti-pattern per GNOME HIG), overlay scrolling and `tightening_threshold` matching Clamp to prevent layout width shifts ([#117](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/117))

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Mouse not working in Midnight Commander and ncurses apps** — split view panel click handlers used `EventSequenceState::None` in capture phase, which prevented VTE from receiving raw button-press events for mouse tracking; changed to `EventSequenceState::Denied` so VTE processes mouse clicks for ncurses apps (mc, vim, htop); also unified TERM to `xterm-256color` everywhere (Flatpak previously used `rustconn-256color` which broke mouse tracking)
- **SFTP connection slow with Bitwarden backend** — double-clicking an SFTP connection triggered full Bitwarden credential resolution (~12s of sequential `bw status` + `bw list items` calls) even though mc uses SSH key in agent, not vault passwords; connections with `password_source` set to None or Prompt now skip async vault resolution entirely, benefiting all protocols — not just SFTP
- **External RDP tab shows only toolbar, content area empty** — `EmbeddedSessionTab::new()` determined embed mode from `DisplayServer::supports_embedding()` which returns `true` on both Wayland and X11; when `start_external_rdp_session` created the tab, it got an empty `DrawingArea` (meant for XEmbed) instead of the `StatusPage` with FreeRDP hotkeys; added `force_external` parameter so external sessions always render the informational StatusPage; also added `show_tab_view_content()` call for layout consistency and `markup_escape_text` to protect against special characters in connection names
- **Group edit: SSH settings toggle reopens confirmation dialog in a loop** — clicking "Clear" in the "Clear SSH Settings?" confirmation dialog triggered the `enable_expansion_notify` signal recursively, causing the dialog to reopen immediately; added a guard flag to prevent re-entry
- **Incomplete translations for Dynamic Folder strings** — "Dynamic Folder", "Generate connections from a script", "Working Directory", "Timeout (seconds)", "Shell command executed via sh -c", "Refreshed" toast, and error messages were marked fuzzy in all 16 `.po` files and displayed in English; provided correct translations and removed fuzzy flags for all languages
- **Bulk actions: "Move to Group" icon missing** — `folder-move-symbolic` is not available in all icon themes; replaced with standard `folder-drag-accept-symbolic` from Adwaita
- **External RDP (FreeRDP) fails on changed server certificate** — external xfreerdp always used `/cert:tofu` with no way to override; when a server certificate changed, the connection was silently rejected; added `ignore_certificate` field to `RdpConfig` and "Accept Certificate" checkbox in the RDP connection dialog; when enabled, removes stored FreeRDP certificate (`~/.config/freerdp/server/` and `known_hosts2`) and passes `/cert:ignore`; also fixed: password not passed to `sdl-freerdp3` (now uses `/p:`), `disable_nla` not forwarded to external client (now passes `/sec:nla:off`), connection errors not shown to user (now displays toast with parsed FreeRDP error), tab remained open after FreeRDP window closed (now auto-closes via process monitor), tab placeholder showed keyboard shortcuts and auto-close hint ([#112](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/112))

### Added
- **Smart Folders in sidebar** — the Smart Folders section is now visible in the sidebar below the connection list; dynamically groups connections based on tag, protocol, host pattern, and group filters using AND logic; shows match count badge per folder; "Add" button and right-click context menu (Edit / Delete) fully wired; "New Smart Folder" option added to empty-space context menu; smart folders auto-refresh on every sidebar reload; hidden by default, toggled via toolbar button with persisted visibility state ([#111](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/111))
- **Group-level Expect rules & post-login scripts inheritance** — `ConnectionGroup` now supports `expect_rules` and `post_login_scripts` fields; connections with empty automation config automatically inherit from their parent group chain (same walk-up-hierarchy pattern as SSH/credential inheritance with cycle detection); applies to all terminal protocols: SSH, Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes, MOSH, Zero Trust; set expect rules once on a group and all 600+ connections inherit them automatically ([#110](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/110))
- **Mouse passthrough option for VTE terminal** — new "Mouse passthrough" toggle in Settings → Terminal → Behavior; when enabled (default), mouse clicks and scroll wheel events are forwarded to terminal applications that request mouse tracking (Midnight Commander buttons, vim visual selection, htop scrolling); disables VTE's fallback scrolling so scroll wheel is sent as mouse events on alternate screen; hold Shift to select text when mouse passthrough is active
- **CLI: `--keep-alive-interval`, `--keep-alive-count`, `--ssh-verbose`, `--ignore-certificate` flags** — `add` and `update` commands now support SSH keep-alive settings (`ServerAliveInterval`, `ServerAliveCountMax`), SSH verbose/debug output (`-v` flag), and RDP certificate acceptance; previously these settings were only configurable via the GUI connection dialog
- **CLI: `snippet edit`, `template edit`, `cluster edit`, `smart-folder edit` subcommands** — all four resource types now have full CRUD via CLI; `snippet edit` supports `--new-name`, `--command`, `--description`, `--category`, `--tags`; `template edit` supports `--new-name`, `--host`, `--port`, `--user`, `--description`; `cluster edit` supports `--new-name`, `--broadcast`; `smart-folder edit` supports `--new-name`, `--protocol`, `--host-pattern`, `--tags` (use `"none"` to clear a filter); previously editing required delete+create

### Documentation
- **Auto-login with stored passwords** — added comprehensive troubleshooting section to User Guide explaining how to configure auto-login: Password Source must be "Vault", lookup key formats for each backend (KeePass hierarchical, libsecret flat, Bitwarden/1Password prefixed), common issues table with fixes ([#114](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/114))

### Improved
- **Vault entry missing toast notification** — when credential resolution finds no vault entry for a connection, a warning toast now shows "Vault entry not found for '{name}'" instead of silently falling back to a password prompt; helps users understand why auto-login didn't work ([#114](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/114))
- **"Test credential resolution" button in connection dialog** — new ✓ button next to the password field performs a vault lookup using the current connection name, host, protocol, and group; shows the exact lookup key used and whether the vault returned a password; helps users verify their vault configuration before connecting ([#114](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/114))
- **Multi-language SSH password prompt detection** — VTE password injection now recognizes password prompts from SSH servers configured in non-English locales; supported: German (Passwort/Kennwort), French (mot de passe), Spanish (contraseña), Portuguese (senha), Ukrainian/Belarusian (пароль), Polish (hasło), Czech/Slovak (heslo), Dutch (wachtwoord), Swedish (lösenord), Danish (adgangskode), Chinese (密码/密碼), Japanese (パスワード), Korean (비밀번호); previously only English prompts triggered auto-fill ([#114](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/114))
- **GNOME HIG: sidebar toolbar decluttered** — removed Import/Export buttons from the bottom toolbar (accessible via hamburger menu Ctrl+I and context menu); reduces button count from 8 to 6 for cleaner appearance per GNOME HIG recommendations

### Dependencies
- Boundary CLI 0.21.2 → 0.21.3 (security: CVE fixes in pgx/v5 and go-ntlmssp)
- Hoop.dev CLI 1.59.3 → 1.62.0
- Tailscale CLI 1.96.5 → 1.96.4 (1.96.5 was platform-specific, not available for Linux)
- rpassword 7.5.1 → 7.5.2
- zvariant 5.10.1 → 5.11.0

## [0.12.9] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Export group exports entire tree instead of selected subtree** — when exporting a specific group via the Export dialog's group filter, all groups were included in the output file even though connections were correctly filtered; now both connections and groups are filtered to the selected group and its descendants; previously importing such an export recreated the entire group hierarchy instead of just the selected branch

### Added
- **Snippet variable substitution from Global Variables** — snippets containing `${VARIABLE}` placeholders now automatically resolve values from Global Variables (Menu → Tools → Variables) before execution; if all variables are resolved, the snippet executes immediately without showing the input dialog; partially resolved variables pre-fill the dialog with known values; resolution order: Global Variables → snippet-defined defaults → manual input; uses the same `VariableManager` and vault-backed secret resolution as Expect rules and SSH connections
- **Dynamic Folders** — new `DynamicFolderConfig` on `ConnectionGroup` allows generating connections from an external script; the script runs via `sh -c` with configurable timeout (default 30s) and optional working directory; output is a JSON array of `[{name, host, port?, protocol?, username?, group?, tags?, description?}]`; connections are read-only (`is_dynamic` flag) with stable deterministic UUIDs across refreshes; supports SSH, RDP, VNC, SPICE, Telnet, and MOSH protocols; async executor in `rustconn-core/src/dynamic_folder.rs` with entry validation, warnings for empty name/host, and `thiserror`-based error types; model in `rustconn-core/src/models/dynamic_folder.rs`; **GUI**: group edit dialog with ExpanderRow for script/timeout/working directory/refresh interval configuration; context menu "Refresh Dynamic Folder" action with async execution and toast notifications; **CLI**: `dynamic-folder list`, `dynamic-folder show`, `dynamic-folder refresh` subcommands with table/JSON/CSV output

### Improved
- **CLI `group edit` extended** — `group edit` now supports `--new-name`, `--parent` (use "none" for root), `--description`, and `--icon` in addition to the existing SSH inheritance fields; enables full group management from the CLI without GUI
- **CLI `dynamic-folder set/remove`** — full CRUD for dynamic folders via CLI: `set` creates or updates the script configuration on any group, `remove` clears the configuration and deletes generated connections

## [0.12.8] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Generic async cache `Cached<T>`** — new `rustconn-core/src/cache.rs` module providing a thread-safe, TTL-based cache with automatic refresh via the `LoadCacheObject` trait; uses double-checked locking with `tokio::sync::RwLock` for concurrent read access; supports incremental updates through `previous_value` parameter, explicit invalidation, and configurable TTL (default 60s); replaces ad-hoc caching patterns across the codebase 
- **Busy-state indicator `BusyStack`** — new `rustconn-core/src/busy.rs` module providing a thread-safe RAII counter for tracking in-flight operations; callback fires on 0→1 (busy) and 1→0 (idle) transitions; nested operations handled correctly without extra callbacks; `Clone` for sharing across components; **integrated into GUI** — header bar spinner appears during connection attempts via `glib::MainContext` channel bridge 
- **Extended `ProtocolCapabilities`** — added 9 new capability flags: `multi_monitor`, `usb_redirection`, `port_forwarding`, `wayland_forwarding`, `x11_forwarding`, `session_recording`, `remote_monitoring`, `command_snippets`, `wake_on_lan`; enables UI to adapt controls per-protocol 
  - SSH: `port_forwarding`, `wayland_forwarding`, `x11_forwarding`, `session_recording`, `remote_monitoring`, `command_snippets`
  - RDP: `multi_monitor`
  - SPICE: `multi_monitor`, `usb_redirection`, `audio`
  - All terminal protocols: `session_recording`, `remote_monitoring`, `command_snippets`, `wake_on_lan`
  - All graphical protocols: `wake_on_lan`
- **Connection fallback chain `ConnectionFallback<T>`** — new `rustconn-core/src/connection/fallback.rs` module providing a generic mechanism for trying multiple connection strategies in priority order; `ConnectionStrategy` trait with `name()`, `is_available()`, and async `connect()`; unavailable strategies are skipped automatically; `FallbackError` collects all attempt details for diagnostics; integrated with `tracing` for structured logging 
- **Virt-viewer `.vv` file open support** — RustConn can now open `.vv` files (SPICE/VNC from libvirt, Proxmox VE, oVirt) directly from the file manager or command line (`rustconn file.vv`); adds `StartupAction::VvFile`, `VirtViewerImporter::parse_vv_file()` convenience method, `application/x-virt-viewer` MIME type registration in desktop file and metainfo, and MIME XML definition; completes parity with `.rdp` file support 
- **Connection failure toast** — when a connection fails to start, an error toast now shows the connection name (`"Connection to 'name' failed"`); previously the sidebar turned red with no further feedback

### Dependencies
- Teleport CLI 18.7.5 → 18.7.6 (security: authorization bypass in encrypted session recordings, cross-node recording access, SSRF via AWS database endpoint)

## [0.12.7] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Group credentials: Variable source shows password field instead of variable selector** — when editing a group and choosing "Variables" as the credential type, the dialog incorrectly displayed a password entry field; now shows a dropdown populated with secret global variables, matching the behavior of individual connection editing ([#109](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/109))
- **Group credentials: saving Variable source stored empty string** — selecting "Variable" and saving the group produced `PasswordSource::Variable("")` instead of the actual variable name; now correctly reads the selected variable from the dropdown
- **Group credentials: no validation for empty variable selection** — saving with "Variable" source when no secret global variables exist silently stored an empty variable name; now shows a validation error prompting the user to select a variable

### Improved
- **GNOME HIG: accessible labels for group credential widgets** — added `LabelledBy` relations for the password source dropdown, password entry, and variable dropdown in the group edit dialog so screen readers can announce their purpose
- **GNOME HIG: menu button tooltip shows F10 shortcut** — the hamburger menu button tooltip now reads "Menu (F10)", consistent with other header bar buttons that show their keyboard shortcut
- **GNOME HIG: "SSH Tunnels" moved to Tools section** — SSH Tunnels was in the App section alongside Settings/About/Quit; moved to the Tools section where it logically belongs with other management dialogs
- **GNOME HIG: "Settings" menu item ellipsis** — "Settings" now shows as "Settings..." to indicate it opens a window, per GNOME HIG ellipsis convention
- **GNOME HIG: "Keyboard Shortcuts" added to app menu** — the existing `app.shortcuts` action (F1) was not discoverable from the hamburger menu; added "Keyboard Shortcuts..." entry in the App section before About, matching standard GNOME app layout

### Documentation
- **User Guide: group credentials rewritten** — replaced outdated KeePass/Keyring/Bitwarden password source list with the current unified model (Prompt, Vault, Variable, Inherit, None); documented that Variable source shows a dropdown of secret global variables
- **User Guide: F10 shortcut** — added F10 (Open Menu) to the Application keyboard shortcuts table

## [0.12.6] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Expect script variables not substituted** — `${MY_PASSWORD}` and other `${VAR}` references in Expect rule responses were sent as literal text instead of being resolved to their actual values; now uses `VariableManager` to substitute global variables before creating automation triggers ([#105](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/105))
- **GNOME HIG: missing ellipsis on menu items** — "Active Sessions" and "SSH Tunnels" in the hamburger menu now use ellipsis ("Active Sessions...", "SSH Tunnels...") to indicate they open a dialog/window, per GNOME HIG conventions
- **False `c-format` flag on command palette search string** — `xgettext` incorrectly marked `"Search connections, > commands, @ tags, # groups, % tabs"` as a C format string; `% T` was interpreted as a format specifier, causing `msgfmt --check` to fail in 14 languages; removed the flag from POT and all 16 PO files
- **Corrupted `Plural-Forms` in uk.po** — `%` characters in the Ukrainian plural formula were replaced with `{}` placeholders during a previous i18n update; restored the correct `nplurals=3` formula

### Added
- **SSH verbose mode for connection debugging** — new "Verbose" toggle in SSH connection settings adds `-v` flag to the SSH command, showing detailed debug output in the terminal to help diagnose connection issues such as resets by remote devices ([#106](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/106))
- **Sidebar width setting** — new "Sidebar width" control in Settings → Appearance allows adjusting the sidebar width from 260 to 500 pixels; applied immediately and persisted across sessions ([#96](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/96))
- **SSH Tunnel Manager** — standalone window for managing headless SSH port-forwarding tunnels without terminal sessions; supports Local/Remote/Dynamic forwards, auto-start on launch, auto-reconnect, and references existing SSH connections for host/key configuration; accessible via menu or Ctrl+T ([#96](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/96))

### Improved
- **GNOME HIG: tunnel delete confirmation** — deleting a tunnel from the SSH Tunnel Manager now shows an `AdwAlertDialog` confirmation ("Delete Tunnel? — Tunnel "…" will be permanently removed.") with a destructive "Delete" button; previously the tunnel was removed immediately without confirmation
- **GNOME HIG: tunnel dialog inline validation** — the Save button in the Add/Edit Tunnel dialog is disabled while the tunnel name is empty, preventing accidental saves of unnamed tunnels; previously the dialog silently refused to save without any visual feedback

### Documentation
- **User Guide: SSH Tunnel Manager** — complete section with create/manage workflow, tunnel options table, use case examples, and comparison with per-connection port forwarding
- **User Guide: SSH verbose mode** — new section under SSH → Session Options with configuration steps and when-to-use guidance
- **User Guide: Expect variable substitution** — documented `${VARIABLE_NAME}` placeholder support in Expect rule responses with multi-step login example
- **User Guide: Sidebar width** — added to Settings → Appearance documentation
- **User Guide: context menu corrections** — removed non-existent "View Details" entry, fixed "Pin to Favorites"→"Pin / Unpin" to match code, added undocumented "Run Snippet..." and "Start/Stop Recording" entries, clarified Copy/Paste Connection scope (sidebar focus + hamburger menu only)
- **User Guide: Ctrl+T shortcut** — added SSH Tunnel Manager shortcut to Keyboard Shortcuts table

### Translations
- All 16 languages (be, cs, da, de, es, fr, it, kk, nl, pl, pt, sk, sv, uk, uz, zh-cn) aligned to 1748 translatable strings with 0 untranslated entries
- **Chinese Simplified (zh-cn)** — merged community translation update from GaaChun ([PR #108](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/pull/108)); filled 36 new strings from 0.12.6; 20 fuzzy entries remaining (upstream review pending)

## [0.12.5] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Settings dialog overflows after Hoop.dev install** — `hoop version` outputs JSON (`{"version":"1.59.3","git_commit":"...","build_date":"..."}`) which was displayed as-is in the version suffix label, stretching the `AdwToolbarView` to 1331 px and breaking the 700 px settings dialog layout; added a dedicated `hoop` parser that extracts only the `"version"` field
- **kubectl version not shown in settings** — `kubectl version --client --short` fails on kubectl ≥ 1.28 (`error: unknown flag: --short`); switched to `kubectl version --client` and parse `Client Version: vX.Y.Z`
- **Tray icon SIGSEGV on restart** — `connect_shutdown` did not drop the `TrayManager`, so D-Bus callbacks could reference already-finalized GObjects during GTK teardown; now explicitly drops the tray manager in the shutdown handler before flushing persistence
- **Teleport CLI download URL 404** — pinned version 18.7.6 did not exist on the CDN; corrected to 18.7.5

### Dependencies
- Hoop.dev CLI 1.56.1 → 1.59.3
- Teleport CLI 18.7.6 → 18.7.5 (URL fix)

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **"Copy Password" from context menu resolves from vault** — previously only worked with cached credentials (required connecting first); now falls back to `resolve_credentials_gtk` to fetch the password directly from the configured secret backend (KeePass, Bitwarden, 1Password, etc.) when no cached credentials are available

### Cleaned
- **Removed dead `mosh.rs` dialog module** — standalone MOSH options panel was never wired into the connection dialog; MOSH settings are already integrated into the SSH tab via `ssh::create_ssh_options()`
- **Removed legacy `connect_password_load_button` wrapper** — unused passthrough method in `ConnectionDialog` that delegated to `connect_password_load_button_with_groups` with empty groups; all callers already use the `_with_groups` variant directly

### Added
- **Import button in Cloud Sync settings** — "Available in Cloud" section now shows an "Import" button on each unimported `.rcn` file; clicking it creates an Import group and triggers an immediate sync, importing all connections from the file

### Dependencies
- rpassword 7.4.0 → 7.5.0
- rustls 0.23.39 → 0.23.40

## [0.12.3] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Sync toast shows raw placeholders instead of values** — the Cloud Sync notification displayed `%1`, `%2`, `%3`, `%4` instead of actual connection counts because `i18n_f()` only supports `{}` placeholders; changed both sync message strings and all 16 translations to use `{}` format

### Accessibility
- **Icon-only buttons missing accessible labels** — added `update_property(accessible::Property::Label)` with `i18n()` wrappers to 24 icon-only buttons across 15 files (password generator, terminal search, history, cluster management, split view, SSH agent, settings tabs, flatpak components); screen readers now correctly announce button purpose instead of just the icon name

### Dependencies
- Teleport CLI 18.7.4 → 18.7.6
- clap_complete 4.6.2 → 4.6.3
- gio 0.22.5 → 0.22.6, glib 0.22.5 → 0.22.6, glib-macros 0.22.2 → 0.22.6
- gtk4 0.11.2 → 0.11.3
- pango 0.22.4 → 0.22.6
- zbus 5.14.0 → 5.15.0, zvariant 5.10.0 → 5.10.1

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Flatpak SFTP ssh-add fails with missing askpass** — `ssh-add` inherited the host's `SSH_ASKPASS` (e.g. `ksshaskpass` on KDE) which doesn't exist inside the Flatpak sandbox, causing "No such file or directory" and blocking mc/file-manager SFTP; now strips `SSH_ASKPASS` from the environment for all bare `ssh-add` calls ([#102](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/102))
- **Blocking operations on GTK main thread** — `has_secret_backend()` and `refresh_secret_backend_cache()` called `block_on(is_available())` without timeout on the main thread, freezing the UI if the secret backend was unresponsive; added 5-second timeouts to both methods
- **Missing timeouts on blocking async operations** — `flush_persistence()` (app shutdown), `resolve_with_hierarchy()` (credential fallback), `auto_unlock()` (Bitwarden), and all vault store/retrieve/delete operations in `dispatch_vault_op()` could hang indefinitely; added timeouts (5s for persistence, 30s for credential resolution and Bitwarden unlock, 10s for vault operations) to prevent infinite blocking

### Translations
- All 16 languages (be, cs, da, de, es, fr, it, kk, nl, pl, pt, sk, sv, uk, uz, zh-cn) aligned to 1697 translatable strings
- **Italian (it)** — fixed syntax error in PO file (curly quotes breaking msgfmt)
- **Chinese Simplified (zh-cn)** — 20 fuzzy entries remaining (community-contributed, pending upstream review)

### Dependencies
- FreeRDP 3.24.1 → 3.25.0 (switched to pub.freerdp.com release tarballs)

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Split view content disappearing on panel focus switch** — clicking between split panels caused the content to vanish because the click handler called `switch_to_tab()` which navigated the TabView away from the split-owner's tab (where the split widget lives) to the clicked session's placeholder tab; removed the `switch_to_tab()` call — focus is now handled entirely via `set_focused_pane()` and `grab_focus()` ([#101](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/101))
- **Flatpak SFTP mc host key prompt on every connect** — mc FISH uses SSH internally but could not find the Flatpak-writable `known_hosts` file because `~/.ssh` is read-only in the sandbox; now creates a thin SSH wrapper script that injects `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` and the correct `UserKnownHostsFile`, prepended to `$PATH` for the mc process ([#102](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/102))
- **cargo-deny CI failure** — removed deprecated `unlicensed` and `copyleft` keys from `deny.toml` `[licenses]` section (removed in cargo-deny v2, see [PR #611](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/611))
- **cargo-audit CI failure** — added `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` (rsa Marvin Attack) to `[advisories].ignore` in `deny.toml`; transitive dependency via ironrdp/sspi and spice-client with no upstream fix available

### Dependencies
- Bitwarden CLI 2026.3.0 → 2026.4.1 (fixes supply chain attack in 2026.4.0)
- kubectl 1.35.4 → 1.36.0

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Cloud Sync** — synchronize connection configurations between devices and team members through any shared cloud directory (Google Drive, Syncthing, Nextcloud, Dropbox, USB)
  - **Group Sync** — per-group `.rcn` files with Master/Import access model and name-based merge
  - **Simple Sync** — single-file bidirectional sync with UUID-based merge and tombstone deletion tracking
  - **SSH Key Inheritance** — group-level SSH settings (key path, auth method, proxy jump, agent socket) inherited by child connections; `ssh_key_path` remains local-only per device
  - **Credential Resolution UX** — interactive `AdwAlertDialog` prompts when variables or secret backends are missing at connect time
  - **File Watcher** — automatic import on `.rcn` file changes via `notify` crate with 3s debounce
  - **Cloud Sync Settings page** — `AdwPreferencesPage` with sync directory, device name, synced groups, available files, and Simple Sync toggle
  - **Sidebar sync indicators** — `emblem-synchronizing-symbolic` for synced groups, `dialog-warning-symbolic` for errors
  - **Import group UI restrictions** — synced fields read-only, local fields editable, context menu restrictions
  - **CLI sync commands** — `sync status`, `sync list`, `sync export`, `sync import`, `sync now`
- **Accessible labels** — added `update_property` accessible labels to icon-only buttons (password visibility toggle, password load, RDP quick actions)
- **cargo-deny + cargo-audit in CI** — security advisory checks, license allow-list, ban wildcards, source registry restrictions
- **Document dirty badge** — CSS dot indicator replaces text `"• "` prefix for unsaved documents in sidebar
- **Tab Overview** — grid view of all open tabs (GNOME Web-style) via button on the tab bar or **Ctrl+Shift+O**; makes navigating 10+ tabs significantly easier ([#100](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/100))
- **Tab Switcher in Command Palette** — `%` prefix in Command Palette (or **Ctrl+%**) opens fuzzy search across all open tabs; shows protocol and tab group in results ([#100](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/100))
- **Tab Pinning** — right-click a tab → Pin Tab to keep it always visible at the left edge of the tab bar; pinned tabs don't scroll away ([#100](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/100))
- **Custom terminal themes** — create, edit, and delete custom color themes (background, foreground, cursor, full 16-color ANSI palette) from Settings → Terminal → Colors; custom themes are persisted to `~/.config/rustconn/custom_themes.json` and appear alongside built-in themes in the dropdown ([#98](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/98))
- **Group Jump Host dropdown** — group SSH settings now include a Jump Host dropdown (select from existing SSH connections) in addition to the manual ProxyJump text field; stored as `ssh_jump_host_id` with inheritance support via `resolve_ssh_jump_host_id()`

### Improved
- **Tab Overview + Split View architecture** — complete refactoring of the TabView/SplitView architecture so that split layouts live inside TabPages instead of a global container; Tab Overview now renders correct thumbnails for all tabs including split-view tabs without SIGSEGV crashes or blank previews
- **Split view "Select Tab" popover** — the session picker popover in empty split panels now shows color indicators for sessions already displayed in other split views
- **Split view placeholder** — when a session is moved to another tab's split layout, its own tab shows a "Displayed in Split View" status page with a "Go to Split View" button for quick navigation
- **Split color indicators preserved** — switching between tabs no longer clears the colored dot indicators on split-view tabs
- **Group settings: GNOME HIG enable switches** — Default Credentials and SSH Settings sections now use `AdwExpanderRow` with `show_enable_switch(true)`; when disabled, all fields are cleared to `None`, giving clear semantics of "not configured" vs "configured but empty"
- **SSH tunnel password authentication** — SSH tunnels (used by RDP, VNC, SPICE jump host connections) now support password-authenticated jump hosts via `SSH_ASKPASS` mechanism; previously `BatchMode=yes` was unconditional, silently blocking password auth
- **VTE passphrase prompt guard** — VTE password auto-fill now explicitly rejects SSH key passphrase prompts (`"Enter passphrase for key"`) to prevent sending the wrong secret when SSH auth method is PublicKey
- **Connection dialog: protocol-aware Password Source** — Password Source dropdown is now hidden for protocols that don't use stored passwords (Telnet, Serial, MOSH, Kubernetes, Zero Trust); previously visible but non-functional for these protocols
- **Credential Resolution UX fully wired** — `CredentialResolutionResult` enum now drives the connection flow: `VariableMissing` shows the variable setup `AdwAlertDialog` (enter value + select backend → Save & Connect), `BackendNotConfigured` shows the backend missing dialog (Enter Manually / Open Settings), `VaultEntryMissing` falls through to the protocol's password prompt; previously the resolver silently returned `None` on all failure paths
- **Sidebar sync error indicators** — synced groups now show `dialog-warning-symbolic` with error tooltip when the last sync operation failed (e.g. parse error, missing file); previously always showed the generic synced icon regardless of error state
- **Custom themes atomic write** — `custom_themes.json` now uses temp file + rename (atomic write) with `0600` permissions and `tracing::warn` on errors; consistent with sync file write pattern

### Dependencies
- notify 7 (new — file watching for Cloud Sync)
- hostname 0.4 (new — default device name)
- slug 0.1 (new — sync filename generation)
- Tailscale CLI 1.96.4 → 1.96.5
- cc 1.2.60 → 1.2.61, data-encoding 2.10.0 → 2.11.0, hybrid-array 0.4.10 → 0.4.11, libc 0.2.185 → 0.2.186, rustls-pki-types 1.14.0 → 1.14.1

### Fixed
- **System tray SIGSEGV and empty menu** — tray icon menu could randomly appear empty or crash the application with `object_ref: assertion '!object_already_finalized' failed` (SIGSEGV) on startup; root cause was `ksni::Handle::update()` calling `block_on()` on the GTK main thread which deadlocked with the D-Bus service loop competing for the `TrayState` mutex, and conflicted with the application's tokio runtime guard; moved all D-Bus updates to a dedicated `tray-updater` background thread with coalescing `sync_channel(1)`, moved `TrayManager` creation to a `tray-init` background thread, added re-activation guard in `build_ui`, and ensured polling timers stop when the window is finalized
- **Tab Overview SIGSEGV with split-view tabs** — opening Tab Overview when split-view tabs were active caused Pango `size >= 0` assertion failures and crashes because `AdwTabOverview` attempted to snapshot `TabPage` children with 0×0 allocation; refactored to keep `TabView` always visible with per-tab `TabPageContainer` wrappers that guarantee non-zero allocation
- **Tab Overview blank previews** — split-view tabs showed empty thumbnails in Tab Overview because terminals were reparented to a global split container outside `TabView`; terminals now stay inside `TabPage` children at all times
- **Terminal theme reset when Settings dialog is closed** — closing the Settings dialog applied the global terminal color theme to all terminals, overwriting per-connection theme overrides (custom background/foreground/cursor colors); now re-applies connection-specific theme overrides after global settings are applied ([#99](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/99))
- **Pango assertion failure on zero font size** — guarded against `font_size == 0` in terminal configuration and settings collection to prevent `pango_font_description_set_size: assertion 'size >= 0' failed` crashes when the settings dialog returns an invalid value
- **Highlight rules show color instead of hover-only underline** — VTE's `match_add_regex()` only underlines text on mouse hover without color; added a Cairo `DrawingArea` overlay that reads visible terminal text, runs `CompiledHighlightRules::find_matches()` per line, and draws colored background rectangles and foreground underlines in real time; `SourcePattern` now carries `foreground_color`/`background_color` from the rule ([#97](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/97))

## [0.11.7] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Monitoring bar broken after scrollbar addition** — the terminal scrollbar (added in 0.11.6) changed the session container from vertical to horizontal layout, causing the monitoring bar to appear side-by-side with the terminal instead of below it; wrapped the horizontal terminal+scrollbar row in a vertical outer container so the monitoring bar is correctly appended underneath
- **Monitoring collector keeps running in split view** — when a session entered split view the monitoring bar was removed but the SSH exec collector continued polling the remote host every 3 seconds; added `suspend_monitoring`/`resume_monitoring` to `MonitoringCoordinator` that stops the collector on split entry and restarts it (with stored connection params) when the session returns to tab view

### Documentation
- **User Guide restructured** — reorganized USER_GUIDE.md from 41 flat sections (~4000 lines) into 13 logically grouped sections (~2000 lines); protocols, sessions, organization, and productivity tools are now grouped by topic instead of scattered across the document
- **CLI Reference extracted** — moved the full CLI command reference (~700 lines) to a dedicated [CLI_REFERENCE.md](docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md) for easier navigation
- **Zero Trust Providers extracted** — moved all Zero Trust provider documentation (~220 lines) to a dedicated [ZERO_TRUST.md](docs/ZERO_TRUST.md)
- **FAQ and Troubleshooting merged** — combined the previously separate FAQ, Troubleshooting, and Migration Guide sections to reduce duplication

### Dependencies
- clap_mangen 0.2.33 → 0.3.0

## [0.11.6] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Terminal scrollbar** — VTE terminals now display a vertical scrollbar (using a standalone `GtkScrollbar` connected to VTE's `vadjustment`, the same approach as GNOME Terminal); scrollbar is shown by default and can be toggled in Settings → Terminal → Scrolling ([#95](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/95))
- **"Execute Snippet…" in terminal context menu** — right-clicking inside a terminal now shows an "Execute Snippet…" option that opens the snippet picker; follows GNOME HIG (no nested submenus, verb label with ellipsis) ([#95](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/95))

### Fixed
- **Sidebar status stays gray after reconnect** — clicking "Reconnect" on a disconnected SSH/VTE session now immediately sets the sidebar status to "connecting" (yellow) instead of leaving it gray; the status then transitions to "connected" (green) once the session is established ([#96](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/96))
- **Context menu intermittently fails to open on right-click** — reverted sidebar popover from `autohide(true)` back to `autohide(false)` because GTK4's pointer grab consumed right-click events before the gesture handler could fire; added manual Escape key handler and window `focus-widget` tracking to auto-dismiss the menu when a dialog opens ([#87](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/87))

### Dependencies
- pastey 0.2.1 → 0.2.2
- rustls 0.23.38 → 0.23.39

## [0.11.5] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Simplified Chinese (zh-cn) translation** — complete translation of all 1573 UI strings; contributed by GaaChun ([PR #94](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/pull/94))
- **User Guide: libvirt NSS hostname resolution** — added troubleshooting section explaining how to resolve VM hostnames via the libvirt NSS module when connecting with RDP/VNC from Flatpak or native installs ([#91](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/91))

### Dependencies
- picky-asn1-der 0.5.5 → 0.5.6
- rustls-webpki 0.103.12 → 0.103.13
- winnow 1.0.1 → 1.0.2
- kubectl 1.35.3 → 1.35.4

## [0.11.4] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Sidebar flashes red during SSH connection** — connecting via SSH (and other protocols with port check) briefly showed "failed" (red) status before switching to "connected" (green); introduced `ConnectionStartResult` enum to distinguish async port check in progress (`Pending`) from real failures (`Failed`); the sidebar now stays yellow ("connecting") until the port check completes
- **Context menu stays open when dialog opens** — the sidebar context menu remained visible when opening a dialog via keyboard shortcut or toolbar button (e.g. "New Connection"); switched the popover from `autohide(false)` to `autohide(true)` so GTK4 automatically dismisses it when focus moves elsewhere ([#93](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/93))
- **Sidebar stays "connecting" after cancelling password dialog** — closing the VNC or RDP password prompt without entering credentials left the sidebar status stuck on yellow ("connecting"); the status is now cleared on cancel
- **VNC/RDP with "None" password source prompts immediately** — when Password Source is set to "None", the first connection attempt now uses an empty password; the password dialog is only shown on retry (second attempt) if authentication fails
- **Cannot save SSH connection with default key** — validation incorrectly required an explicit SSH key path even when Key Source was set to "Default"; the check now only applies when Key Source is "File"

### Dependencies
- Teleport CLI 18.7.3 → 18.7.4
- 1Password CLI 2.33.1 → 2.34.0

## [0.11.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **CLI: `--jump-host` flag for `add` and `update`** — set a jump host (SSH bastion) when creating or updating SSH, SFTP, RDP, VNC, and SPICE connections via CLI; accepts connection name or UUID; validates that the referenced connection exists and prevents self-referencing
- **SSH Jump Host for VNC and SPICE** — VNC and SPICE connections now support SSH jump host tunnelling via `ssh -L` local port forwarding; the tunnel process is managed automatically and killed on tab close; port check is skipped when jump host is configured
- **SSH tunnel stderr capture** — SSH tunnel process stderr is now read in a background thread and logged via `tracing::warn`; diagnostic messages (auth failures, port unreachable) are available via `SshTunnel::stderr()` and logged on process exit
- **SSH tunnel health monitoring** — `SshTunnel::is_alive()` checks whether the SSH process is still running; `wait_for_tunnel_ready()` now detects early process exit and fails fast with a descriptive error instead of polling until timeout
- **CLI: `show` displays Jump Host** — `rustconn-cli show` now prints the resolved jump host name for SSH, SFTP, RDP, VNC, and SPICE connections

### Fixed
- **RDP via jump host stuck at "connecting"** — embedded IronRDP connections through an SSH tunnel could hang indefinitely when the remote host was unreachable (firewall DROP); the handshake timeout for tunnel connections is now capped at 15 seconds (down from 60s) and produces a clear error message ([#92](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/92))
- **Flatpak: kubectl and Hoop.dev missing from settings and PATH** — kubectl and Hoop.dev CLI were not shown in the Settings → Clients detection tab and their install directories were missing from the Flatpak PATH extension; added "Container Orchestration" section to settings, added Hoop.dev to "Zero Trust Clients", and registered both directories in `get_cli_path_dirs()` and `find_in_flatpak_cli_dir()`
- **Sidebar status not set on connection start** — "connecting" (yellow) status is now shown immediately on double-click, before credential resolution or tunnel creation begins; previously the status only appeared after the tunnel was established
- **Sidebar status not cleared on RDP error** — non-protocol errors (timeout, unreachable host) now fire the `on_state_changed(Error)` callback, which closes the tab and sets "failed" (red) status; previously the sidebar stayed yellow after a timeout
- **Sidebar "failed" status overridden by Disconnected** — the `Disconnected` handler no longer calls `decrement_session_count` for sessions that were never connected; this prevents the "failed" status set by the Error handler from being cleared back to empty
- **RefCell panic on RDP error** — `handle_ironrdp_error` now uses take-invoke-restore pattern for `on_state_changed` and `on_error` callbacks; the previous `borrow()` approach caused a re-entrancy panic when the callback triggered `close_tab` → `adw_tab_view_close_page` → `Disconnected` state change
- **RDP error toast** — a toast notification ("RDP connection failed. Check that the remote host is reachable.") is now shown when an embedded RDP connection fails before ever connecting

### Improved
- **RDP handshake phase logging** — debug log messages now mark each handshake phase (X.224 negotiation, TLS upgrade, NLA/capabilities) so the exact hang point is visible in logs
- **TCP_NODELAY for tunnel connections** — Nagle's algorithm is disabled on the TCP stream to the tunnel, reducing latency for the RDP handshake
- **Tunnel timeout error message** — tunnel connections show "Connection failed: RDP handshake timed out after 15s — the remote host may be unreachable through the SSH tunnel or the RDP service is not running" instead of generic "Operation timed out"

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Reconnect reuses existing tab for all VTE protocols** — clicking "Reconnect" on a disconnected session now respawns the process in the same terminal tab instead of closing and creating a new one; works for SSH, Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes, ZeroTrust (all providers), and MOSH; tab position, tab group, and split view state are fully preserved ([#89](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/89))
- **RDP port check skipped with jump host** — pre-connect TCP port check is now skipped for RDP connections that have a jump host configured; the destination is only reachable through the SSH tunnel, so direct probing always timed out
- **Hoop.dev CLI download** — `releases.hoop.dev` removed the `latest` URL alias (HTTP 403); switched to versioned URL format; pinned to 1.56.1
- **Azure/gcloud/OCI CLI wrapper test in Flatpak** — `az --version` verification after pip install crashed with `Read-only file system`; now sets Flatpak-writable config dirs during wrapper script test
- **Flatpak SFTP always uses mc** — SFTP in Flatpak now always opens via Midnight Commander; `xdg-open sftp://` is unreachable from the sandbox

### Improved
- **Reconnect banner consistent across all protocols** — RDP, VNC, and SPICE sessions now show the "Session disconnected / Reconnect" banner at the bottom of the tab (same position as SSH/Telnet) instead of a button in the top-right toolbar
- **Sidebar width tuned for HiDPI** — default sidebar width lowered from 360px to 320px and fraction from 30% to 27%; saved widths from older versions are reset on upgrade; fixes overly wide sidebar on 4K displays with 200% scaling while keeping all protocol filter icons visible

### Added
- **SSH Jump Host for RDP** — SSH jump host selector is now available for RDP connections; the session is tunnelled through the selected SSH bastion host via `ssh -L` local port forwarding; tunnel process is managed automatically and killed on tab close ([#90](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/90))
- **Tab context menu: Close Others / Left / Right / All / Ungrouped** — right-click a tab for browser-style close actions: close all other tabs, close tabs to the left or right, close all ungrouped tabs, or close all tabs
- **CLI: all protocols and Zero Trust providers** — `rustconn-cli add` now supports all 10 protocols (`ssh`, `rdp`, `vnc`, `spice`, `sftp`, `telnet`, `serial`, `mosh`, `k8s`, `zt`) and all 11 Zero Trust providers with provider-specific flags (`--aws-region`, `--gcp-zone`, `--resource-group`, `--boundary-target`, etc.)

### Documentation
- **Complete CLI reference in User Guide** — comprehensive documentation for all 23 CLI commands with syntax, options tables, examples for every protocol and Zero Trust provider, shell completions, Flatpak usage with alias, and scripting examples

### Dependencies
- open 5.3.3 → 5.3.4
- openssl 0.10.77 → 0.10.78
- openssl-sys 0.9.113 → 0.9.114
- typenum 1.19.0 → 1.20.0
- Hoop.dev CLI pinned to 1.56.1

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Reconnect preserves tab position** — clicking "Reconnect" on a disconnected session now opens the new tab at the same position in the tab bar instead of appending it to the end; fixes workflow disruption when managing 10+ SSH sessions ([#89](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/89))
- **Context menu handoff between items** — right-clicking a second sidebar item while a context menu is already open now correctly closes the first menu and opens the new one; previously the second menu failed to appear due to GTK4 popover lifecycle conflicts ([#87](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/87))
- **Stale highlight on right-click** — right-clicking multiple sidebar items in succession no longer leaves residual selection highlights on previously clicked rows; the context menu gesture now claims the event sequence to prevent GTK4 from applying sticky `:active` / `:focus-within` pseudo-classes to row widgets
- **Context menu requires single right-click** — switching the context menu between sidebar items now works with a single right-click instead of requiring two clicks (first to dismiss, second to open); achieved by disabling `autohide` on the popover and managing dismissal explicitly via gesture handlers

### Improved
- **Context menu layout follows GNOME HIG** — sidebar context menu items reordered to match GNOME Files conventions: primary action (Connect) at top, organisation (Rename / Duplicate / Move) next, utilities (Copy credentials, SFTP, WOL) in the middle, creation and properties (New Connection, Edit) before the destructive action (Delete) at the bottom
- **MSRV bumped to 1.95** — required by `constant_time_eq` 0.4.3 (transitive dependency via `zip`)

### Improved
- **`SshOptionsWidgets` tuple replaced with named struct** — the 24-element tuple type alias in `ssh.rs` is now a proper struct with named fields; adding new SSH options is a single-point change instead of updating ~6 destructuring sites across `dialog.rs`
- **Split view context menu shares popover lifecycle with sidebar** — split view panel right-click menu now uses the same `ACTIVE_POPOVER` tracking as the sidebar; right-clicking panel B while panel A's menu is open correctly closes the first menu; also fixes cross-component conflicts where a sidebar menu and split view menu could fight for the GTK4 popover grab; menu labels now wrapped in `i18n()` for localization
- **Auto-reconnect guard for closed tabs** — polling callback now checks if the session still exists in `sessions_map` before triggering reconnect; prevents creating an orphan tab if the user manually closes the tab while background polling is active
- **SSH config importer applies `Host *` defaults** — `Host *` entries in `~/.ssh/config` are now parsed as global defaults and merged into each host entry (host-specific values take priority); previously `Host *` was skipped entirely, losing settings like `ServerAliveInterval 60` that apply to all hosts

### Added
- **SSH Keep-Alive settings** — dedicated `Keep-Alive Interval` and `Keep-Alive Count` spin rows in the SSH Connection options group; generates `-o ServerAliveInterval=N` and `-o ServerAliveCountMax=M` flags to prevent idle disconnects caused by firewalls or server timeouts; new connections default to 60s interval / 3 retries; custom_options take precedence if the same key is set manually ([#88](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/88))
- **SSH Config import/export for Keep-Alive** — `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` from `~/.ssh/config` are now mapped to dedicated fields instead of only `custom_options`; exporter outputs them as separate directives with deduplication

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **General tab migrated to adw:: widgets** — connection dialog General tab rebuilt with `adw::PreferencesGroup`, `adw::EntryRow`, `adw::SpinRow`, `adw::ComboRow`, and `adw::PasswordEntryRow`; replaces manual Grid+Label+Entry layout with native GNOME HIG sections (Identity, Connection, Authentication, Organization); 30-element tuple replaced with `BasicTabWidgets` struct; content wrapped in `adw::Clamp` (max 600px) for consistent width; Entry suffix widgets constrained with `width_chars`/`max_width_chars`
- **Legacy XOR encryption migration warning** — credentials still using XOR obfuscation are transparently migrated to AES-256-GCM on load; a toast notification shows the count of migrated credentials; XOR support will be removed in v0.12
- **State access helpers** — `with_state()`, `try_with_state()`, `with_state_mut()`, `try_with_state_mut()` helper functions reduce RefCell borrow panics; documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Runtime warning for `block_on_async`** — logs `tracing::warn` when GTK main thread is blocked for >100ms, suggesting `spawn_async` instead
- **Accessible label for Command Palette list** — screen readers now announce the results list as "Search results"
- **Desktop entry translations** — added `Comment[lang]` translations for uk, de, fr, es, cs

### Improved
- **RDP connection state structured** — `handle_ironrdp_error()` 13-parameter signature replaced with `RdpConnectionContext` struct
- **Automation task validation hardened** — import warnings for connections with automation/expect rules; sensitive env vars (`BW_SESSION`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) cleared before task execution
- **Localized constants and port descriptions** — `(Root)`, `(None)`, `(No keys loaded)`, and port range labels (`Well-Known`, `Registered`, `Dynamic`) now wrapped in `i18n()` for translation
- **Sidebar GNOME HIG color consistency** — sidebar pane and tab bar backgrounds unified with `@headerbar_bg_color` for GNOME Files-like appearance; bottom toolbar buttons use `.flat` style; separator between search and list hidden for seamless look; works correctly in both light and dark themes
- **KeePass button visibility** — active vault button now uses normal icon color instead of `.suggested-action` (which rendered white-on-white in light theme); inactive state uses `.dim-label`
- **Focus border only in split view** — `.focused-panel` accent border is now hidden when only one panel exists; previously showed a distracting border around the welcome screen and single-tab sessions

### Fixed
- **Split view tab colors preserved across Settings** — opening the Settings dialog no longer resets colored indicators on split view tabs; the root cause was that `apply_protocol_color()` / `clear_protocol_color()` guards relied on an unpopulated `session_tab_ids` map, so they always overwrote split indicators when `set_color_tabs_by_protocol()` was called on dialog close
- **Group Operations mode no longer breaks sidebar layout** — replaced text buttons with compact icon-only pill buttons matching the protocol filter bar style; toolbar wrapped in animated `Revealer` (SlideDown 200ms) instead of abrupt `set_visible()`; delete button uses `@error_color` for visual distinction
- **Split view context menu Copy/Paste/Select All now works** — action group `terminal.*` was installed on the TabView container which is lost when the terminal is reparented into a split panel; moved to the VTE terminal widget itself so actions follow the widget through reparenting

### Security
- **Automation env var sanitization** — task executor removes sensitive environment variables before spawning shell commands
- **Lazy Bitwarden credential decryption** — Bitwarden master password and API credentials are now decrypted at startup only when Bitwarden is the preferred backend; previously they were unconditionally decrypted into memory even when KeePass or other backends were active

### Dependencies
- libbz2-rs-sys 0.2.2 → 0.2.3
- rand 0.8.5 → 0.8.6
- rtoolbox 0.0.4 → 0.0.5

## [0.10.22] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Terminal context menu Copy/Paste now works** — replaced custom `GestureClick` popover with VTE's native `set_context_menu_model()` API; the old approach broke clipboard actions because the popover stole focus from VTE before callbacks could run ([#84](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/84))
- **No more `gdk_clipboard_write_async` assertion** — Copy action now caches selected text via `text_selected()` before VTE clears the selection on right-click, preventing the `mime_type != NULL` GDK critical warning
- **Blank menus on X11 (MATE, XFCE)** — GTK4's NGL renderer causes popovers to render blank until hovered on some X11 compositors; RustConn now auto-detects X11 sessions and falls back to the Cairo renderer via process re-exec ([#85](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/85))

### Improved
- **Context menu labels localized** — Copy, Paste, Select All strings now wrapped in `i18n()` for translation

### Dependencies
- pxfm 0.1.28 → 0.1.29
- tokio 1.52.0 → 1.52.1
- uuid 1.23.0 → 1.23.1

## [0.10.21] - 2026-04-16

### Security
- **Machine key encryption hardened** — removed predictable `hostname+username` fallback from `get_machine_key()`; `/etc/machine-id` fallback now uses HKDF-SHA256 with app-specific salt; `.machine-key` file created with `0600` permissions

### Fixed
- **Groups expand/collapse on double-click** — double-clicking anywhere on a group row now toggles expand/collapse, not just the expander icon ([#83](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/83))
- **Ctrl+K no longer hijacks terminal** — removed `Ctrl+K` from the global search shortcut; only `Ctrl+F` focuses the search box now, so `Ctrl+K` passes through to terminal applications like nano ([#83](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/83))
- **Right-click context menu on all SSH profiles** — set gesture propagation phase to `Capture` so the right-click handler fires before `TreeExpander` internal handlers that could swallow the event ([#83](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/83))
- **Filter bar opens below search box** — swapped layout order so protocol filters appear below the search entry instead of above it, preventing UI jump ([#83](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/83))

### Improved
- **Sidebar accessible labels localized** — wrapped `"Search connections"`, `"Search syntax help"`, `"Connection list"`, and `"Filter by {protocol} protocol"` in `i18n()` / `i18n_f()` for screen reader localization

### Dependencies
- aws-lc-rs 1.16.2 → 1.16.3
- aws-lc-sys 0.39.1 → 0.40.0
- clap 4.6.0 → 4.6.1

## [0.10.20] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **RDP shared folders only used first folder path** — RDPDR backend now maps each drive to its own base path via `device_id`, so multiple shared folders work correctly in embedded IronRDP mode ([#82](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/82))
- **Tailscale CLI download broken by macOS-only release** — pinned version 1.96.5 only existed for macOS; downgraded to 1.96.4 (latest Linux build) and switched from static checksum to `SkipLatest` policy to prevent future platform-specific release breakage ([#81](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/81))
- **SSH Port Forwarding section missing from connection dialog** — the Port Forwarding group was silently not added because fragile widget tree navigation (`first_child → downcast → child → ...`) failed; now uses the content box directly from `create_ssh_options()` return value ([#80](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/80))

### Docs
- **Flatpak shared folders troubleshooting** — added "RDP Shared Folders in Flatpak" section to User Guide with `flatpak override` commands for granting filesystem access ([#82](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/82))

## [0.10.19] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Shell button in header bar** — moved the Local Shell button from the sidebar filter bar to the main header bar as a prominent accent-colored pill button with icon and label; always visible even when sidebar is hidden ([#76](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/76))
- **Optional protocol filter bar** — protocol filters can now be toggled on/off via a button in the search bar or in Settings → Interface → "Show protocol filters"; state is persisted across sessions; hidden by default for a cleaner interface ([#76](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/76))
- **Toggle protocol filters action** — `win.toggle-protocol-filters` window action with sidebar toggle button that persists visibility state to config
- **Tab group chooser dialog** — "Set Group..." dialog now shows existing groups as clickable pill buttons for quick selection, with a text field for creating new groups; no  manual retyping of group names
- **Close All in Group** — new context menu action on grouped tabs; shows a confirmation dialog with tab count and group name, then closes all tabs belonging to that group
- **Group name in tab tooltip** — hovering over a grouped tab now shows `[GroupName]` in the tooltip, visible even when split view colors are active
- **Group name as tab title prefix** — tab groups now display as a `[GroupName]` prefix in the tab title instead of a colored indicator icon; this separates group identity from split view / protocol color indicators, so both are visible simultaneously

### Fixed
- **Terminal not auto-focused after connection** — newly opened SSH session tabs now automatically grab keyboard focus so the user can type immediately; uses idle callback with selected-page guard to prevent focus-stealing when multiple tabs open concurrently ([#79](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/79))
- **SIGSEGV on rapid right-click on tab** — triple right-clicking a terminal tab caused a segfault because each click created a new popover without unparenting the previous one; now tracks the active popover and tears it down before creating a new one
- **Tray menu labels empty when "Minimize to tray" enabled** — the ksni tray `menu()` callback runs on a D-Bus worker thread where `gettext` is not initialised, causing `i18n()` to return empty strings; tray menu now uses plain English labels to avoid the thread-safety issue; window visibility is synced via periodic polling so the Show/Hide toggle stays correct
- **Tab group color conflict with split view** — tab groups and split view previously competed for the same `indicator_icon` slot; groups now use a title prefix while split view keeps the colored indicator, eliminating the conflict

### Improved
- **Wider sidebar** — increased minimum sidebar width from 160px to 360px for better readability of nested items and long hostnames; increased OverlaySplitView max from 280px to 360px default with up to 600px maximum
- **Filter bar cleanup on hide** — active protocol filters are automatically cleared when the filter bar is hidden to prevent invisible filtering confusion

### Dependencies
- bitflags 2.11.0 → 2.11.1
- clap_complete 4.6.1 → 4.6.2
- FreeRDP 3.24.0 → 3.24.1 (security fixes)
- hyper-rustls 0.27.8 → 0.27.9
- rand 0.9.3 → 0.9.4
- rayon 1.11.0 → 1.12.0
- rustls-webpki 0.103.11 → 0.103.12
- tokio 1.51.1 → 1.52.0
- VTE 0.80.0 → 0.80.3

## [0.10.18] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Terminal font zoom** — dynamically scale terminal font size using Ctrl+Scroll wheel, Ctrl+Plus/Minus keyboard shortcuts, and Ctrl+0 to reset; uses VTE's native `font_scale` for per-session zoom (0.5×–4.0×) ([#77](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/77))
- **Copy on select** — optional X11-style auto-copy: selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard; enable in Settings → Terminal → Behavior ([#78](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/78))

### Improved
- **Export group filter** — export dialog now includes a group selector to export only connections from a specific group and its subgroups; defaults to "All connections"
- **Import/Export format ordering** — RustConn Native (.rcn) is now the default format in both import and export dialogs; remaining formats sorted alphabetically

### Dependencies
- gio 0.22.4 → 0.22.5
- glib 0.22.4 → 0.22.5
- hyper-rustls 0.27.7 → 0.27.8
- libc 0.2.184 → 0.2.185
- openssl 0.10.76 → 0.10.77
- openssl-sys 0.9.112 → 0.9.113
- pkg-config 0.3.32 → 0.3.33
- rtoolbox 0.0.3 → 0.0.4
- rustls 0.23.37 → 0.23.38

## [0.10.17] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **`clear` command not working in Flatpak SSH sessions** — the Flatpak sandbox inherits `TERM=dumb` from the host, and the previous fix only set `rustconn-256color` for local shells; remote commands (SSH, Telnet, etc.) kept the inherited `dumb` value, breaking `clear`, `htop`, `mc`, `tmux` on remote hosts; now force `TERM=xterm-256color` for all remote commands in Flatpak ([#25](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/25))
- **Sidebar scroll position lost after editing/moving connections** — `restore_state()` scheduled group expansion, scroll restoration, and selection as three independent idle callbacks that raced against each other; scroll was applied before groups finished expanding (which changes content height), causing the sidebar to jump to the top; now runs expansion and selection synchronously in one callback, then restores scroll in a chained second callback
- **Sorting collapsed all expanded groups** — `sort_connections()` and `sort_recent()` rebuilt the sidebar store without saving/restoring expanded group state; now preserves which groups were open before sorting

### Dependencies
- clap_complete 4.6.0 → 4.6.1
- rand 0.9.2 → 0.9.3
- Tailscale CLI 1.96.4 → 1.96.5

## [0.10.16] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Sidebar context menu actions still not working** — the v0.10.15 fix using `insert_action_group()` proxy was insufficient: `PopoverMenu` inside a `ListView`/`TreeExpander` hierarchy cannot reliably resolve `win.*` actions regardless of where the action group is injected; replaced `PopoverMenu` + `gio::Menu` with a plain `Popover` containing `Button` widgets that directly call `window.activate_action()`, completely bypassing GTK4 action-group resolution ([#75](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/75))

### Dependencies
- cc 1.2.59 → 1.2.60
- gif 0.14.1 → 0.14.2
- hashbrown 0.16.1 → 0.17.0
- indexmap 2.13.1 → 2.14.0
- js-sys 0.3.94 → 0.3.95
- ksni 0.3.3 → 0.3.4
- libredox 0.1.15 → 0.1.16
- redox_syscall 0.7.3 → 0.7.4
- rustls-webpki 0.103.10 → 0.103.11
- wasm-bindgen 0.2.117 → 0.2.118
- web-sys 0.3.94 → 0.3.95

## [0.10.15] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **`clear` command not working in Flatpak** — the `clear` binary from ncurses-utils was missing inside the Flatpak sandbox; added a minimal ANSI escape sequence wrapper (`\033[H\033[2J\033[3J`) to all three Flatpak manifests so `clear` works out of the box ([#25](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/25))
- **Sidebar context menu items not working** — after migration to `PopoverMenu` in v0.10.14, clicking menu items did nothing because the popover lacked access to the window's action group; fixed by explicitly proxying `win.*` actions into the popover via `insert_action_group()` ([#75](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/75))
- **Keyboard shortcuts dialog showed wrong bindings** — 19 discrepancies between the shortcuts help dialog (`shortcuts.rs`) and the actual GTK accelerators (`keybindings.rs`): Ctrl+G was labeled "New group" (actually Password Generator), Ctrl+T was labeled "Open local shell" (actually Ctrl+Shift+T), Ctrl+\` was labeled "Focus terminal" (actually Focus Next Pane), F1 was labeled "Show about dialog" (actually Keyboard Shortcuts); all corrected to match the real bindings
- **Shortcuts dialog missing entries** — added 13 missing shortcuts: Quick Connect, Export, Command Palette, Focus Terminal, Close Pane, Connection History, Statistics, Password Generator, Wake On LAN, Toggle Fullscreen, Toggle Sidebar, and alternative accelerators

### Improved
- **FreeRDP stays at 3.24.1** — 3.24.2 release assets not yet published upstream; keeping 3.24.1 which includes all prior security fixes

### Documentation
- **Keyboard shortcuts fully synchronized** — User Guide shortcuts tables now match the actual keybindings registry; added missing entries for Ctrl+K (Search), Ctrl+PageDown/PageUp (tab switching), Ctrl+Shift+T (Local Shell), Ctrl+H (History), Ctrl+G (Password Generator), Ctrl+Shift+I (Statistics), Ctrl+Shift+L (Wake On LAN)
- **Terminal clear troubleshooting** — added User Guide section explaining VTE's Ctrl+L behavior (scrolls instead of erasing) and workarounds for `clear` command in Flatpak

## [0.10.14] - 2026-04-09

### Dead code cleanup
- **Removed unused CSS classes** — removed `.tab-icon`, `.tab-label`, `.tab-label-disconnected`, `.tab-close-button` (replaced by AdwTabView), `.focused-pane`/`.unfocused-pane` (replaced by `.focused-panel`), `notebook > header > tabs > tab` selector (no longer using GtkNotebook), and stale comment placeholders; updated section headers for clarity

### Improved
- **Success notifications use Toast instead of modal dialogs** — snippet creation, cluster creation now show non-blocking `adw::Toast` instead of `adw::AlertDialog` (GNOME HIG compliance); remaining `show_success` calls with detailed counts (import/export/delete) kept as alerts
- **Fixed missing i18n for export/connection test dialogs** — `"Export Complete"`, `"Connection Test Successful"`, and `"Connection successful! Latency: Xms"` were hardcoded English; now wrapped in `i18n()`/`i18n_f()` for proper localization
- **Accessible labels for status icons and split panels** — sidebar connection status icons (`Connected`, `Connecting`, `Connection failed`) now use `i18n()` for localized screen reader announcements; split panel containers have accessible `"Terminal panel"` label
- **Sidebar context menus migrated to PopoverMenu** — replaced manual `Button`-based `Popover` with `PopoverMenu` + `gio::Menu` for both connection/group and empty-space context menus; provides native GNOME HIG look, keyboard arrow navigation, and screen reader accessibility out of the box

### Fixed
- **Sidebar context menu missing Delete action** — context menu for both connections and groups was cut off at the bottom, hiding the Delete item; fixed by attaching popover to the clicked widget instead of the window, allowing GTK to properly calculate available space and scroll long menus

### Documentation
- **RDP File Transfer** — added User Guide section documenting shared folders (drive redirection) and clipboard file transfer (IronRDP embedded mode "Save Files" button)
- **Complete translations for all 15 languages** — filled all empty/fuzzy translations for be, cs, da, de, es, fr, it, kk, nl, pl, pt, sk, sv, uk, uz; fixed broken PO headers in 10 files; updated version to 0.10.14

## [0.10.13] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **SSH auto-reconnect infinite loop** — when an SSH session failed with "Permission denied" (exit code 255), the auto-reconnect polling detected the host as online (TCP port open) and immediately triggered a reconnect, which failed again with the same auth error, creating an exponential loop of sessions. Fixed by skipping auto-reconnect for SSH authentication failures (exit code 255); the user can still reconnect manually via the overlay button
- **Duplicate `child-exited` handlers for SSH/Telnet** — `setup_child_exited_handler` was called twice per session (before and after spawn), registering two GLib signal handlers. Each exit event fired both handlers, spawning two parallel auto-reconnect polls per failure cycle and doubling the session count on every iteration

### Dependencies
- FreeRDP 3.24.0 → 3.24.1 (security fix: CVE patches for credential zeroing, codec fixes)
- Boundary CLI 0.21.1 → 0.21.2 (search sorting flags)
- tokio 1.51.0 → 1.51.1, toml_edit 0.25.10 → 0.25.11

## [0.10.12] - 2026-04-07

### Security
- **VNC password stored as `SecretString`** — `VncConfig.password` changed from plain `String` to `secrecy::SecretString`, matching RDP/SSH/SPICE credential handling; password is now zeroized on drop and protected from accidental logging via `Debug` trait
- **VNC pixel buffer max resolution guard** — `VncPixelBuffer::new()` and `resize()` now clamp dimensions to 16384×16384 (1 GB max), preventing OOM from a malicious VNC server claiming absurd resolution

### Improved
- **RDP 4K frame conversion zero-copy** — `convert_to_bgra()` now returns `Cow<[u8]>` instead of `Vec<u8>`; when pixel data is already in BGRA format (the common IronRDP case), the function returns a borrowed slice instead of cloning the entire frame buffer (33 MB at 4K per frame)
- **Sidebar search highlight regex cached** — `highlight_match()` now accepts a pre-compiled `Regex` via new `compile_highlight_regex()` helper; the regex is compiled once per query change instead of once per visible list item per keystroke
- **Log sanitization custom patterns pre-compiled** — `SanitizeConfig` now pre-compiles custom regex patterns at construction time instead of recompiling on every call to `sanitize_output()`; affects every line of terminal output when session logging is enabled
- **Log sanitization redundant `to_lowercase()` removed** — `SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` are already lowercase constants; removed unnecessary `pattern.to_lowercase()` allocation on every pattern comparison

### Dead code cleanup
- **Removed `wayland_surface.rs`** — ~1050-line stub module with no callers; all types (`WaylandSubsurface`, `EmbeddedRenderer`, `ShmBuffer`, `DamageRect`, `RenderingMode`) were unused; native Wayland subsurface support can be restored from git history when needed
- **Removed `TracingOutput::OpenTelemetry` variant** — deprecated placeholder that was never constructed; match arm fell back to stderr
- **Removed RDPDR `FileLock` struct and `notify_directory_change()` stub** — dead code placeholders for unimplemented fcntl integration
- **Removed commented-out code** — `set_allow_bold` (VTE4 incompatible), `--full-screen` SPICE arg

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: fastrand 2.4.0→2.4.1, gdk4 0.11.1→0.11.2, gdk4-sys 0.11.1→0.11.2, gio 0.22.2→0.22.4, glib 0.22.3→0.22.4, gtk4 0.11.1→0.11.2, gtk4-sys 0.11.1→0.11.2, libz-sys 1.1.26→1.1.28, pango 0.22.0→0.22.4, zip 8.5.0→8.5.1
- **CLI downloads** — TigerVNC 1.16.1→1.16.2 (security fix for x0vncserver), Teleport 18.7.2→18.7.3, Bitwarden CLI 2026.2.0→2026.3.0

## [0.10.11] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **RDP Mouse Jiggler** — prevents idle disconnect by sending periodic mouse movements; configurable interval (10–600 seconds, default 60); auto-starts when RDP session connects, auto-stops on disconnect; works with both IronRDP embedded and FreeRDP external modes; settings in Connection Dialog → RDP → Features
- **Connect All in Folder** — right-click a group in the sidebar → "Connect All" opens all connections in that group simultaneously
- **Copy Username / Copy Password from context menu** — right-click a connection → "Copy Username" or "Copy Password" copies credentials to clipboard; password auto-clears from clipboard after 30 seconds for security; uses cached credentials resolved during previous connection
- **Host Online Check** — right-click a connection → "Check if Online" starts async TCP port probing (polls every 5s for up to 2 minutes); auto-connects when host becomes reachable; shows toast notifications for status updates
- **WoL + Auto-Connect** — Wake On LAN now automatically polls the host after sending the magic packet (up to 5 minutes) and auto-connects when the host comes online; replaces the previous fire-and-forget WoL behavior
- **Auto-reconnect on session failure** — when an SSH session disconnects unexpectedly (server reboot, network failure), RustConn automatically starts polling the host (every 5s for up to 5 minutes) and reconnects when the server comes back online; the reconnect banner is still shown for manual reconnect if auto-reconnect times out
- **Host check module** (`rustconn-core::host_check`) — async TCP connect probe with configurable timeout, polling interval, and max duration; cancellation support via `AtomicBool`; `check_host_online()` for single probe, `poll_until_online()` for continuous monitoring
- **Terminal Activity Monitor** — per-session activity and silence detection for terminal tabs, inspired by KDE Konsole ([#72](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/72)); three monitoring modes: Off (default), Activity (notify when new output appears after a configurable quiet period), and Silence (notify when no output occurs for a configurable timeout); notifications delivered through tab indicator icons, in-app toasts, and desktop notifications (when window is unfocused); per-connection config overrides global defaults; settings in Connection Dialog → Advanced → Activity Monitor and Settings → Monitoring → Activity Monitor; tab context menu "Monitor: Off/Activity/Silence" for quick mode cycling; property-based tests for mode cycling, serde round-trip, config resolution, and timeout clamping

### Fixed
- **RDP tabs auto-close on initial connection failure** — RDP tabs that fail during initial connection (CredSSP auth error, connection refused, timeout) now close automatically instead of showing a useless "failed" tab; disconnected tabs are still shown for sessions that were previously connected (for reconnect)
- **Group context menu detection** — fixed `is_group` detection in sidebar context menu to use `ConnectionItem.is_group()` instead of icon name check; groups with custom emoji icons now correctly show group-specific menu items (Connect All, New Connection in Group)

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: fastrand 2.3.0→2.4.0

## [0.10.10] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- **Flatpak: removed extra sandbox permissions rejected by Flathub lint** — reverted `--filesystem=home/.hoop:ro`, `--filesystem=xdg-run/gnupg:ro`, `--filesystem=home/.var/app/com.bitwarden.desktop/data:ro`, and `--filesystem=xdg-run/ssh-agent:ro` from Flatpak and Flathub manifests; these permissions are now added manually by users via `flatpak override` after installation (see [Flatpak Sandbox Overrides](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#flatpak-sandbox-overrides)); prompted by [flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint#972](https://github.com/flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint/pull/972#pullrequestreview-4051168156)

### Added
- **User Guide: Flatpak Sandbox Overrides section** — documents how to add filesystem permissions for alternative SSH agent sockets (KeePassXC, Bitwarden, GPG agent, 1Password) and Hoop.dev CLI config after Flatpak installation ([User Guide → Flatpak Sandbox Overrides](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#flatpak-sandbox-overrides))

### Improved
- **Bulk delete dialog migrated to AdwAlertDialog** — replaced custom `adw::Window` with `adw::AlertDialog` using `set_close_response("cancel")` and `ResponseAppearance::Destructive`, following GNOME HIG for destructive confirmation dialogs
- **Background thread result delivery** — `spawn_blocking_with_callback` now uses event-driven `glib::MainContext::channel()` instead of 16ms polling timer, reducing unnecessary main loop wake-ups
- **vault_ops unit tests** — added 14 tests for `select_backend_for_load` (8 backend selection scenarios including KeePass fallback logic) and `generate_store_key` (6 key format scenarios across LibSecret, Bitwarden, 1Password, Pass backends)

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: cc 1.2.58→1.2.59, coreaudio-rs 0.14.0→0.14.1, indexmap 2.13.0→2.13.1, libz-sys 1.1.25→1.1.26, semver 1.0.27→1.0.28, tokio 1.50.0→1.51.0, tokio-macros 2.6.1→2.7.0, writeable 0.6.2→0.6.3, yuv 0.8.12→0.8.13
- **CLI downloads** — TigerVNC 1.16.0→1.16.1

## [0.10.9] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Hoop.dev Zero Trust provider** — added Hoop.dev as the 11th Zero Trust provider; supports `hoop connect <connection-name>` with optional `--api-url` and `--grpc-url` flags; includes data model (`HoopDevConfig`), CLI detection (`detect_hoop()`), Flatpak CLI download component, GUI fields in connection dialog, CLI support (`--provider hoop_dev --hoop-connection-name`), Flatpak `~/.hoop:ro` permission, serialization round-trip, i18n, and property-based tests
- **Custom SSH agent socket override** — users can now specify a custom `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` path at two levels: a global setting in Settings → SSH Agent tab (applies to all connections) and a per-connection override in Connection Dialog → SSH tab (overrides global and auto-detected socket); resolves the Flatpak limitation where `--socket=ssh-auth` hard-overwrites `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, preventing use of alternative agents like KeePassXC or Bitwarden SSH agent ([#71](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/71))
- **CLI `--ssh-agent-socket`** — `rustconn-cli add` and `update` commands accept `--ssh-agent-socket <PATH>` to set per-connection SSH agent socket; `show` command displays the value when set
- **Socket path validation** — real-time feedback in both Settings and Connection dialogs: green for valid socket, yellow for path not found (non-blocking), red for non-absolute path
- **Flatpak: alternative SSH agent socket access** — added `--filesystem` permissions for GPG agent (`xdg-run/gnupg`), Bitwarden SSH agent (`home/.var/app/com.bitwarden.desktop/data`), and custom sockets (`xdg-run/ssh-agent`) in Flatpak and Flathub manifests

### Fixed
- **Orphaned subgroups on group delete** — deleting a group containing only empty subgroups (0 connections) via the GUI now cascade-deletes all descendant subgroups instead of reparenting them to root; CLI `group delete` now delegates to `ConnectionManager` instead of manual `groups.retain()`, fixing dangling `parent_id` references on child groups
- **Startup error dialog orphaned window** — `show_error_dialog` no longer creates a temporary `ApplicationWindow` that lingers after dismissal; now presents via `app.active_window()` parent

### Security
- **Tar archive path traversal (defense-in-depth)** — CLI component downloads now validate each tar entry path against `..` traversal and absolute paths before extraction, matching the existing `enclosed_name()` protection for zip archives; pinned `tar >= 0.4.45` (CVE-2026-33056)
- **RDP certificate validation** — changed default `ignore_certificate` from `true` to `false`; FreeRDP now uses `/cert:tofu` (trust-on-first-use) by default instead of unconditional `/cert:ignore`; applies to all RDP paths (external FreeRDP, embedded launcher, embedded thread)
- **Bitwarden session key no longer exposed in process list** — session key is now passed via `BW_SESSION` environment variable instead of `--session` CLI argument, preventing exposure in `/proc/PID/cmdline`
- **1Password credentials no longer exposed in process list** — password field values are now piped via stdin instead of passed as CLI arguments to `op item create/edit`
- **Export file permissions hardened** — KDBX XML exports and all connection export files now set `0600` (owner-only) permissions on Unix, preventing world-readable credential/topology data
- **Bitwarden session key cleared on vault lock** — `lock_vault()` now calls `clear_session_key()` alongside `clear_verified()`, ensuring the session key does not persist in memory after lock
- **VNC custom args blocklist** — dangerous VNC viewer arguments (`-via`, `-passwd`, `-passwordfile`, `-securitytypes`, `-proxyserver`, `-listen`) are now blocked, matching the existing RDP custom args blocklist
- **FreeRDP extra args blocklist** — `extra_args` in FreeRDP external mode now filtered through the same dangerous-prefix blocklist (`/p:`, `/password:`, `/shell:`, `/proxy:`) as RDP `custom_args`
- **Pass backend path traversal prevention** — `build_pass_path()` now sanitizes `connection_id` and `field` by replacing `/`, `\`, `.` with `_`, preventing directory traversal in the password store
- **Log sanitization expanded** — added `passphrase:`, `client_secret:`, `authorization:` to sensitive prompt patterns; added GitHub (`ghp_*`), GitLab (`glpat-*`), and JWT (`eyJ*`) token detection to value patterns

### Corrected
- **Flatpak `--device=all` clarification** — v0.9.11 release notes incorrectly stated Flatpak permissions were "scoped to `--device=serial`"; Flatpak has no granular `--device=serial` option — the actual permission is `--device=all`, which is required for serial port access via picocom

### Improved
- **Asbru import regex cached** — `convert_asbru_variables()` now uses `LazyLock<Regex>` instead of compiling the regex on every call, matching the pattern used throughout the rest of the codebase
- **Snippet validation strings translated** — "Snippet name is required" and "Command is required" wrapped in `i18n()` for localization
- **Framebuffer fallback warning** — RDP, VNC, and SPICE embedded viewers now log `tracing::warn!` (once per session) when the legacy `to_vec()` pixel buffer copy path is activated instead of `CairoBackedBuffer`
- **Clippy suppressions scoped to GUI crate** — 8 GTK-specific clippy suppressions (`redundant_clone`, `needless_borrow`, `needless_pass_by_value`, `unused_self`, `wildcard_imports`, `needless_borrows_for_generic_args`, `redundant_closure_for_method_calls`, `redundant_closure`) moved from workspace `Cargo.toml` to `rustconn/Cargo.toml`; `rustconn-core` now linted under stricter rules

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: aws-lc-sys 0.39.0→0.39.1, cc 1.2.57→1.2.58, cmake 0.1.57→0.1.58, hybrid-array 0.4.8→0.4.10, hyper 1.8.1→1.9.0, libc 0.2.183→0.2.184, mio 1.1.1→1.2.0, simd-adler32 0.3.8→0.3.9, system-deps 7.0.7→7.0.8, toml_edit 0.25.8→0.25.10, uuid 1.22.0→1.23.0, winnow 1.0.0→1.0.1, zerocopy 0.8.47→0.8.48, zip 8.4.0→8.5.0, zune-jpeg 0.5.14→0.5.15
- **CLI downloads** — Tailscale 1.96.2→1.96.4

## [0.10.8] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Flatpak: gcloud install fails with read-only filesystem** — `install.sh` now runs with `CLOUDSDK_CONFIG` pointing to the writable sandbox directory, preventing `OSError: [Errno 30]` on `~/.config/gcloud/`

### Improved
- **SPICE/VNC embedded rendering performance** — replaced per-frame `to_vec()` pixel buffer copy with persistent `CairoBackedBuffer` (in-place surface updates + `mark_dirty_rectangle`); eliminates 8–33 MB allocation per frame depending on resolution; same zero-copy pattern already used by embedded RDP since 0.10.7
- **`CairoBackedBuffer` extracted to shared module** — `cairo_buffer.rs` is now used by RDP, VNC, and SPICE embedded widgets instead of three separate implementations
- **`parse_version` regex cached** — `secrets_tab.rs` now reuses `VERSION_REGEX` from `rustconn-core` instead of compiling a new regex on every call
- **`VARIABLE_REGEX` deduplicated** — identical regex was compiled in three modules (`variables/manager.rs`, `snippet/manager.rs`, `utils.rs`); now defined once and re-exported

## [0.10.7] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **RDP default quality mode** — new RDP connections now default to Quality (RemoteFX) instead of Balanced; existing connections with explicitly saved Balanced or Speed settings are not affected

### Fixed
- **SPICE fallback viewer reported as failed** — `connect_with_fallback()` returned an error even when the external SPICE viewer launched successfully; now returns `Ok(())` so the GUI correctly shows the connected state
- **SPICE embedded mouse clicks at wrong position** — click and release events sent coordinates (0,0) instead of the actual cursor position; now applies the same widget-to-framebuffer coordinate transformation as mouse motion
- **RDP file import ignores gateway port** — `.rdp` parser read gateway port from `gatewayaccesstoken` instead of the standard `gatewayport` field; gateway connections now use the correct port
- **Session type misclassified for terminal protocols** — only SSH was classified as embedded; Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes, and MOSH sessions are now correctly classified as terminal-embedded
- **MOSH `--ssh` argument not parsed correctly** — `--ssh=ssh -p PORT` was passed as a single argument; now split into `--ssh` and `ssh -p PORT` as two separate arguments for correct parsing
- **MOSH connections accepted port 0** — `validate_connection()` now rejects port 0, consistent with SSH and other protocols
- **Config file corruption on power failure** — synchronous `save_toml_file` now calls `sync_all()` before atomic rename, matching the async version's durability guarantee
- **CLI `delete` auto-confirms in non-interactive mode** — piped input no longer auto-confirms destructive operations; use `--force` to bypass confirmation in scripts
- **CLI `add` allows duplicate connection names** — now returns an error if a connection with the same name already exists
- **CLI `group delete` leaves orphaned connections** — connections belonging to a deleted group now have their `group_id` cleared
- **CLI `update` uses case-sensitive exact match** — now uses `find_connection` for case-insensitive and fuzzy matching, consistent with other commands
- **FreeRDP 2.x flagged as version-incompatible** — detection entries for `wlfreerdp`/`xfreerdp` (2.x) had `min_version("3.0.0")`; corrected to `"2.0.0"`
- **External window saves default size instead of current** — `setup_close_handler` now uses `window.width()`/`height()` to capture actual dimensions after user resize
- **Cluster dialog buttons break on layout change** — Select All / Deselect All buttons are now stored as struct fields instead of being found via fragile `parent()` traversal
- **Whitespace-only group and snippet names accepted** — `validate_group` and `validate_snippet` now trim names before checking emptiness
- **Tray dirty-check hash collision** — replaced simple timestamp sum with `DefaultHasher` combining connection IDs and timestamps
- **`Connection::default_port` duplicated `ProtocolType::default_port`** — now delegates to `self.protocol.default_port()`

### Security
- **Script credential resolver password not zeroed** — intermediate `String` holding the password from script output is now zeroed via `zeroize::Zeroize` after wrapping in `SecretString`
- **Encrypted credential changes not detected** — `SecretSettings::PartialEq` now includes all `*_encrypted` fields so save-if-changed logic detects credential updates

### Improved
- **Highlight rules performance** — `CompiledHighlightRules` now uses `RegexSet` for fast initial filtering before running individual regexes; avoids executing every pattern on every terminal line
- **Command palette sort performance** — `SearchEngine` is now created once before sorting instead of inside every comparator call
- **GTK main loop polling** — `poll_for_result` uses `timeout_add_local` at 16ms intervals instead of `idle_add_local_once` to avoid busy-spinning
- **Terminal themes cached** — `all_themes()` and `theme_names()` use `OnceLock` to avoid repeated allocation
- **Fuzzy search allocation** — `fuzzy_score_optimized` replaced `to_lowercase()` with allocation-free case-insensitive search
- **Export runs on background thread** — large exports no longer freeze the UI
- **CLI download default allocation** — reduced from 10MB to 1MB for small downloads
- **Group descendant collection** — `collect_descendant_groups` uses `HashSet` for O(1) lookups instead of O(n) `Vec::contains`
- **`parse_args` supports quoted strings** — uses `shell_words::split()` so RDP arguments with spaces and quotes are parsed correctly
- **Tray menu translated** — all tray menu strings wrapped in `i18n()`
- **Password generator tips translated** — security tip strings wrapped in `i18n()`
- **Session restore version validation** — `from_json` now warns on version mismatch for forward compatibility
- **ZeroTrust protocol registry documented** — `get_by_type()` explains that ZeroTrust delegates to provider-specific protocols
- **Wayland subsurface code documented** — dead Wayland native paths annotated as future extension points
- **Duplicate CSS rules removed** — `.status-connected` and `.status-connecting` were defined twice in sidebar CSS
- **Dead Flatpak config helpers removed** — unused `get_flatpak_boundary_config_dir` and `get_flatpak_cloudflared_config_dir`
- **`CredentialResolutionContext` struct** — replaces 8-argument function with a bundled context struct
- **Embedded RDP 4K performance** — replaced per-frame 33MB pixel buffer clone (`data.to_vec()`) with a persistent Cairo `ImageSurface` that is updated in-place via `surface.data()` + `mark_dirty_rectangle()`; eliminates the main bottleneck that caused near-slideshow rendering at 4K resolution; old `PixelBuffer` path kept as fallback for FreeRDP external mode
- **RDP frame extraction optimized** — `extract_region_data` replaced per-pixel copy+swap loop with row-based `memcpy` + bulk R↔B channel swap; full-frame fast path avoids row-by-row copy when region covers entire image; LLVM auto-vectorizes the swap loop into SIMD on x86_64
- **RDP cursor artifacts (random pixels below cursor)** — cursor bitmaps from IronRDP are padded to 32×32 or 64×64 with transparent rows; on HiDPI the downscale + compositor upscale caused color bleeding at transparency edges; now crops transparent padding before downscale and uses premultiplied alpha (`B8g8r8a8Premultiplied`) to prevent bleed; R↔B channel swap moved from session layer to cursor handler to avoid double-swap

## [0.10.6] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Passbolt CLI integration broken with CLI 0.4.2** — `PassboltResourceDetail` deserialization failed because serde looked for `"_id"`, `"_name"`, `"_uri"`, `"_description"` instead of lowercase `"id"`, `"name"`, `"uri"`, `"description"` returned by Passbolt CLI 0.4.2; added `serde(rename)` for all underscore-prefixed fields; made `_id` and `_name` optional since `get resource` no longer returns `id`; added `folder_parent_id` field; same fix applied to `PassboltResource` for `_username` and `_uri` ([#69](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/69))
- **Blurry/artifact RDP image on HiDPI displays** — embedded IronRDP framebuffer was double-scaled on HiDPI (device→CSS→device) because Cairo surface lacked `set_device_scale`; now sets device scale on the pixel buffer surface so Cairo renders 1:1 at native resolution; also uses adaptive filter (Nearest for 1:1, Bilinear for actual scaling)
- **1Password JSON parse errors silently ignored** — `op item list` parse failures were swallowed by `unwrap_or_default()`, masking real issues; now logs warning via `tracing::warn!`

### Changed
- **CLI downloads** — 1Password CLI 2.33.0→2.33.1

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: ipconfig 0.3.2→0.3.4, libredox 0.1.14→0.1.15, proptest 1.10.0→1.11.0

## [0.10.5] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **KeePassXC CLI integration not working** — all vault write/rename/delete/copy operations passed `None` as database password to `keepassxc-cli`, causing "Invalid credentials" errors when the KDBX file is password-protected; now correctly passes `kdbx_password` from settings in all 10 call sites across GUI (`vault_ops.rs`) and CLI (`secret.rs`) ([#68](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/68))
- **KeePassXC CLI silent error swallowing** — `get_password_from_kdbx` silently returned `Ok(None)` for unrecognized errors; `get_password_from_kdbx_with_key` silently skipped failed path attempts; now logs warnings via `tracing::warn!`/`tracing::debug!` for all failure paths
- **KeePassXC CLI missing `-q` flag** — added `-q` (quiet) flag to all `keepassxc-cli show` commands and `verify_kdbx_credentials` to suppress interactive password prompts in scripted usage
- **GTK warnings on application startup** — suppressed `Adwaita-WARNING: gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` on KDE/XFCE by clearing the deprecated property before `adw::init()`; removed unsupported `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` CSS media query that caused GTK theme parser warning

### CI
- **GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation** — replaced `flathub-infra/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@master` (Node.js 20) with `flatpak/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@v6` (Node.js 24)

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: deflate64 0.1.11→0.1.12, toml 1.0.7→1.1.0, zip 8.3.1→8.4.0

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Flatpak: Zero Trust CLIs crash on read-only filesystem** — gcloud, Azure CLI, Teleport, and OCI CLI need writable config directories; Flatpak mounts host dirs as read-only or doesn't mount them at all; now redirects CLI config paths to writable sandbox directories via environment variables (`CLOUDSDK_CONFIG`, `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR`, `TELEPORT_HOME`, `OCI_CLI_CONFIG_FILE`); bootstraps credentials from host mounts where available; Boundary uses system keyring via D-Bus (works natively in Flatpak); Cloudflare Access SSH uses browser-based auth (no persistent config needed); GCP IAP also gets `--ssh-key-file` and `--strict-host-key-checking=no` to handle read-only `~/.ssh/`
- **Flatpak: Zero Trust CLI tools not found** — `is_host_command_available()` used default PATH which doesn't include Flatpak CLI directories (`~/.var/app/.../cli/`); now uses extended PATH from `get_cli_path_dirs()` so AWS SSM, gcloud, and other installed CLIs are detected correctly
- **Failed connections stuck in "connecting" (yellow) state** — when `start_connection()` returned `None` (e.g. missing CLI, validation error), sidebar status was never reset; now transitions to "failed" (red) on connection launch failure
- **VTE runtime warning on regex match registration** — `match_add_regex()` requires `PCRE2_MULTILINE` compile flag; highlight rules and search highlight regexes were compiled with flags=0, causing `_vte_regex_has_multiline_compile_flag` assertion warning

### Improved
- **Flatpak manifests: FreeRDP and Waypipe modules** — added missing `freerdp` module to `packaging/flatpak/io.github.totoshko88.RustConn.yml` and `packaging/flathub/io.github.totoshko88.RustConn.yml`; added missing `waypipe` module to `packaging/flatpak/io.github.totoshko88.RustConn.yml` — matches documentation claim "FreeRDP 3.24.0 bundled in Flatpak"
- **i18n: 3 untranslated UI strings wrapped** — `"Failed to start"` in settings, `"Enter text above to test patterns"` and `"No patterns matched"` in connection dialog highlight rules, `"Import Failed"` in import dialog, `"Pasted {} chars"` in VNC clipboard — all translated across 15 languages
- **Snap license corrected** — `GPL-3.0+` → `GPL-3.0-or-later` (SPDX)
- **ARM64 release builds** — added `build-deb-arm64`, `build-rpm-arm64`, and `build-appimage-arm64` jobs to release workflow using QEMU emulation

- Updated: `moka` 0.12.14→0.12.15, `yuv` 0.8.11→0.8.12
- **CLI downloads** — Tailscale 1.94.2→1.96.2
- **Libvirt daemon import** — new import source "Libvirt Daemon (virsh)" queries running libvirtd for VMs via `virsh dumpxml`, reusing the existing XML parser; supports `qemu:///session`, `qemu:///system`, and remote URIs ([#63](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/63))

## [0.10.3] - 2026-03-21

### Security
- **RDP password no longer exposed in `/proc`** — legacy `RdpLauncher` passed password as `/p:{pass}` CLI argument visible to all system users; now uses `/from-stdin` pipe matching `SafeFreeRdpLauncher` behavior
- **SSH agent askpass script zeroized before deletion** — passphrase temp file in `/tmp/rustconn-askpass-*/` is now overwritten with zeros and fsynced before `remove_dir_all`, preventing recovery after abnormal termination
- **CLI `--password` flag shows security warning** — `rustconn-cli secret set --password` now prints a warning that the value is visible in process listings and recommends the interactive prompt
- **Legacy XOR credential decryption now logged** — transparent XOR→AES-256-GCM migration now emits `tracing::warn!` so administrators can track remaining legacy credentials

### Fixed
- **Highlight rules not applied without per-connection rules** — built-in defaults (ERROR, WARNING, CRITICAL, FATAL) and global highlight rules were skipped when a connection had no per-connection rules; removed the `is_empty()` guard so highlights always apply ([#66](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/66))
- **CLI `add --protocol zerotrust` silently created SSH connection** — now returns an error instead of logging and falling back to SSH
- **Config file corruption on crash** — sync `save_toml_file` now uses atomic temp-file + rename pattern matching the async version
- **Blocking DNS in async `check_port_async`** — replaced `to_socket_addrs()` with `tokio::net::lookup_host()` to avoid blocking the tokio worker thread

### Improved
- **Sidebar shows full connection name on hover** — tooltip displays full name and host for truncated entries; removed `max_width_chars` limit so labels use all available sidebar space
- **Log sanitization performance** — `sanitize_output()` regex patterns compiled once via `LazyLock` instead of on every call; `SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` deduplicated from 29 to 16 lowercase-only entries
- **CLI `parse_protocol` consolidated** — three duplicate implementations in `add.rs`, `template.rs`, `smart_folder.rs` replaced with shared `parse_protocol_type()` + `default_port_for_protocol()` in `util.rs`
- **`ProtocolResult<T>` deduplication** — removed duplicate type alias from `protocol/mod.rs`, now re-exported from `error.rs`
- **OpenTelemetry tracing variant marked deprecated** — `TracingOutput::OpenTelemetry` now has `#[deprecated]` attribute until implementation is complete
- **Dead code cleanup** — removed unused `AppStateError`, `VncLauncher`, `FieldValidator`/`FormValidator` framework, `initialize_secret_backends()`, `create_async_resolver()`

- Updated: `rustls-webpki` 0.103.9→0.103.10, `zune-jpeg` 0.5.13→0.5.14
## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **MOSH connections not working** — `start_connection()` dispatch was missing the `"mosh"` arm; MOSH connections silently failed. Added `start_mosh_connection()` with port check, binary detection, and CLI feedback
- **Auto-recording not triggered** — `session_recording_enabled` toggle in connection dialog had no effect; wired auto-recording into SSH, Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes, and MOSH connection handlers using `connect_contents_changed` callback
- **Highlight rules not applied** — per-connection `highlight_rules` were saved but never passed to `TerminalNotebook`; wired `set_highlight_rules()` call into all protocol handlers after terminal tab creation
- **`script` command visible on recording start** — replaced synchronous `feed()` erase with 100ms delayed erase via `glib::timeout_add_local_once` so PTY echo arrives before the clear sequence; added leading space for `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace`
- **Double exit and UI freeze on recording stop** — replaced `exit\n` with `\x04` (Ctrl+D/EOF) to terminate `script` sub-shell without visible echo; moved SCP file retrieval and remote cleanup to background thread via `spawn_blocking_with_callback`
- **Lost commands in recording playback** — added `strip_script_command_echo()` that removes the echoed `script -q -f --log-out …` line from recording data with timing entry adjustment, analogous to existing `strip_script_header()`
- **.rdp files not opening on double-click** — created `application/x-rdp` MIME type XML definition (`io.github.totoshko88.RustConn-rdp.xml`); installed in all packaging formats: Flatpak, Flathub, OBS RPM/DEB, native install script ([#64](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/64))
- **Sidebar stretching with long connection names** — added `ellipsize(End)` and `max_width_chars(35)` to sidebar connection label ([#64](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/64))
- **picocom not detected in Flatpak** — `picocom --help` returns exit code 1 on v3.x causing detection failure; added `which_binary()` fallback that confirms binary existence without running it ([#62](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/62))
- **RDP "indefinite connection" with no feedback** — improved error message when FreeRDP is not installed: now shows "Install FreeRDP 3.x (xfreerdp3 or wlfreerdp3)" instead of raw error ([#61](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/61))
- **IronRDP debug log spam** — filtered `ironrdp`, `ironrdp_session`, `ironrdp_tokio` crates to `warn` level in tracing subscriber; suppresses noisy `Non-32 bpp compressed RLE_BITMAP_STREAM` messages

### Improved
- **CSV import auto-detects delimiter** — `.tsv` files use tab; for `.csv` files, heuristic compares comma/semicolon/tab counts in the first line and picks the most frequent separator
- **Script credentials test feedback** — "Test Script" button now runs the configured command with 30s timeout, shows success with masked output preview or failure with stderr and exit code
- **Config sync documentation** — added "Configuration Sync Between Machines" section to User Guide with Git, Syncthing/rsync, CLI export/import, and built-in Backup/Restore instructions

- New: `shell-words` 1.x added to `rustconn` crate (script credential test button)
- Updated: `aws-lc-rs` 1.16.1→1.16.2, `aws-lc-sys` 0.38.0→0.39.0, `itoa` 1.0.17→1.0.18, `tar` 0.4.44→0.4.45

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-19

### Note
Thank you to **Todor Todorov** for the support and for pointing out that the donation link was broken. The donation service has been changed and is now working. Today marks 8 months of active development on RustConn. If you'd like to support the project financially, I'd be very grateful: [https://donatello.to/totoshko88](https://donatello.to/totoshko88)

### Added
- **MOSH protocol** — new protocol type with predict mode (Adaptive/Always/Never), SSH port, UDP port range, server binary path, and custom arguments; `MoshProtocol` handler with `build_command()`, `detect_mosh()` in detection module; GUI tab in connection dialog; CLI support
- **CSV import/export** — RFC 4180 compliant CSV parsing and generation; auto column mapping from headers (`name`, `host`, `port`, `protocol`, `username`, `group`, `tags`, `description`); configurable delimiter (comma, semicolon, tab); GUI import dialog with column mapping preview; CLI `import --format csv` and `export --format csv` with `--delimiter` and `--fields` options
- **Session recording** — scriptreplay-compatible format (data + timing files); per-connection toggle in Advanced tab; `●REC` indicator in tab title; sanitization of sensitive output; recordings saved to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rustconn/recordings/`
- **Text highlighting rules** — regex-based pattern matching with foreground/background colors; per-connection and global rules; built-in defaults for ERROR (red), WARNING (yellow), CRITICAL/FATAL (red background); rules editor in Settings and Connection Dialog; VTE integration
- **Ad-hoc broadcast** — send keystrokes to multiple terminals simultaneously; toolbar toggle button with keyboard shortcut; per-terminal checkboxes for selection; separate from existing cluster broadcast
- **Smart Folders** — dynamic connection grouping with filter criteria: protocol type, tags (AND logic), host glob pattern (`*.prod.example.com`), parent group; sidebar section with read-only connection list; create/edit/delete dialogs; CLI `smart-folders list/show/create/delete` subcommands
- **Script credentials** — `PasswordSource::Script` variant for dynamic credential resolution; shell command parsed via `shell-words`; 30-second timeout via `tokio::time::timeout`; stdout trimmed to `SecretString`; GUI entry with Test button in Auth tab
- **Per-connection terminal theming** — color overrides (background, foreground, cursor) per connection in `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` format; 3 `ColorDialogButton` widgets in Advanced tab; Reset button; VTE `set_color_background/foreground/cursor` integration
- **15 new language translations** — all new UI strings for 8 features translated across uk, de, fr, es, it, pl, cs, sk, da, sv, nl, pt, be, kk, uz

- New: `csv` 1.x (RFC 4180 parsing), `glob` 0.3 (Smart Folder host matching), `shell-words` 1.x (script credential argument splitting)
### Fixed
- Flatpak SSH key paths become stale after rebuild — keys copied to stable `~/.var/app/<app-id>/.ssh/` with fallback resolution ([#62](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/62))
- SFTP `ssh-add` uses stale portal key path — resolved via `resolve_key_path()` before use
- SFTP mc opens even when `ssh-add` fails — now aborts with toast error and "failed" status
- `script` command format updated to `--log-out`/`--log-timing` for modern util-linux
- Remote SSH recording used local paths — now extracts SSH config for remote `script` execution
- Recording playback showed `Script started on …` header — stripped with timing adjustment
- `script` invocation visible in terminal — erased via ANSI escape after `feed_child`
- SCP host key verification prompts in `stop_recording()` — added `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`
- RDP sidebar status not clearing after disconnect — `decrement_session_count` called with correct flag
- `PlaybackToolbar` GtkSearchEntry finalization warning — `Drop` unparents popover
- `cargo/config` deprecation warning in Flatpak build — renamed to `config.toml`
- Flatpak local manifest runtime updated from GNOME 50beta to GNOME 50
- Dependencies: euclid 0.22.14, toml 1.0.7, zerocopy 0.8.47, zip 8.3

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-16

> **Note:** Flatpak release will follow after March 18, 2026, when GNOME 50 runtime is published on Flathub.

### Added
- **RDP file import in GUI** — `.rdp` files can now be imported via the Import dialog (Ctrl+I); previously only available through file association and CLI
- **CLI import: 4 new formats** — `rustconn-cli import` now supports `--format rdp`, `rdm`, `virt-viewer`, and `libvirt` in addition to the existing 7 formats
- **Split view for Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes** — split view now works with all VTE terminal-based protocols, not just SSH/SFTP/Local Shell
- **Statistics: Most Used & Protocol Distribution** — statistics dialog now shows top-3 most used connections and protocol usage breakdown with progress bars
- **5 new customizable keybindings** — Toggle Sidebar (F9), Connection History (Ctrl+H), Statistics (Ctrl+Shift+I), Password Generator (Ctrl+G), Wake On LAN (Ctrl+Shift+L); total now 31 actions
- **Sidebar keyboard shortcuts** — F2 renames selected connection/group, Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V copies/pastes connections, Ctrl+M moves to group; all scoped to sidebar focus so they don't intercept VTE terminal or embedded viewer input
- **Dynamic inventory sync** — new `rustconn-cli sync` command synchronizes connections from external JSON/YAML inventory files; matches by source tag + name + host; supports `--remove-stale` to clean absent connections and `--dry-run` for preview ([#56](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/56))
- **RDP file association** — double-clicking an `.rdp` file opens RustConn and connects automatically; supports address, credentials, gateway, resolution, audio, and clipboard fields ([#54](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/54))
- **FreeRDP bundled in Flatpak** — FreeRDP 3.24.0 SDL3 client built into the Flatpak; external RDP works out of the box on Wayland without `DISPLAY`
- **`sdl-freerdp3` detection** — FreeRDP detection now includes SDL3 variants (`sdl-freerdp3`, `sdl-freerdp`); Wayland priority: `wlfreerdp3` > `wlfreerdp` > `sdl-freerdp3` > `sdl-freerdp` > `xfreerdp3`

### Improved
- **i18n: hardcoded English strings wrapped** — ~40 user-visible strings across sidebar, embedded viewers (RDP, VNC, SPICE), session status overlays, and toolbar buttons now use `i18n()` for translation
- **i18n: accessible labels translatable** — ~25 `update_property` accessible labels in sidebar, window UI, embedded toolbar, and viewer controls wrapped with `i18n()`
- **i18n: protocol display names** — wrapped `display_name()` call sites with `i18n()` and added translations for 15 strings across all 15 languages
- **User-friendly VNC error messages** — raw error variants in VNC session toasts replaced with actionable messages ("Authentication failed. Check your credentials.", "Connection error")
- **VTE context menu moved off terminal widget** — `GestureClick` controller for the right-click context menu moved from the VTE terminal to its container widget; prevents interference with VTE's internal mouse event processing in ncurses/slang applications
- **VTE terminal no longer wrapped in ScrolledWindow** — redundant `ScrolledWindow` wrappers removed since VTE implements `GtkScrollable` natively
- **Monitoring module property tests** — 12 new tests covering `MonitoringSettings`, `MonitoringConfig`, `MetricsParser`, and `MetricsComputer`
- **Stale X11 comment removed** — `embedded.rs` comment referencing `GtkSocket` / X11 embedding updated to reflect native protocol clients

### Fixed
- **Secret backend default mismatch** — `SecretBackendType` default changed from `KeePassXc` to `LibSecret` to match User Guide and provide a universal out-of-the-box experience on all Linux desktops

#### Flatpak sandbox
- **waypipe not detected** — C-only build installs as `waypipe-c`, not `waypipe`; added `post-install` symlink in Flatpak manifest; `detect_waypipe()` now also tries `waypipe-c` as fallback; `which_binary()` checks `/app/bin/` directly in sandbox
- **SFTP file manager ignores SSH key** — external file managers (Dolphin, Nautilus) launched via `xdg-open` run outside the sandbox and cannot access the sandbox's SSH agent; `sftp_use_mc` now defaults to `true` in Flatpak so Midnight Commander (bundled) is used instead
- **ssh-agent socket in read-only `~/.ssh`** — `ensure_ssh_agent()` now uses `-a $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rustconn-ssh-agent.sock` inside Flatpak so the agent socket is created in a writable directory
- **KeePassXC not detected** — `keepassxc-cli` on the host system is now detected and executed via `flatpak-spawn --host`; all KDBX operations work transparently inside the sandbox; "Open Password Manager" button launches KeePassXC on the host
- **SSH jump host broken** — replaced `-J` with `-o ProxyCommand=ssh -W %h:%p ...` that passes `StrictHostKeyChecking`, `UserKnownHostsFile`, and identity file to the jump host process
- **mc wrapper not found** — stripped host-exported `mc()` bash function via `--unset-env=BASH_FUNC_mc%%`; installed sandbox wrapper for correct directory-change-on-exit
- **ZeroTrust and Kubernetes connections broken** — CLI tools (`aws`, `gcloud`, `az`, `kubectl`) now detected and executed via `flatpak-spawn --host`; cloud CLI config dirs mounted into sandbox so credentials are shared between sandbox and host
- **mc mouse clicks produce artifacts** — the `xterm-256color` terminfo entry's `XM` extended capability tells ncurses/slang to negotiate SGR mouse mode (1006) with VTE 0.80; mc cannot parse SGR-encoded mouse events, causing raw escape fragments like `7;6M7;6m` on every click; fix: compiled a custom `rustconn-256color` terminfo entry (identical to `xterm-256color` but without `XM`); VTE child processes in Flatpak use `TERM=rustconn-256color` to prevent the negotiation; additionally switched mc build from ncurses to slang and mc SFTP uses `-g` (`--oldmouse`) flag as defense-in-depth

#### Terminal / mc
- **mc SFTP: initial window not fullscreen** — mc read terminal dimensions before VTE widget received its GTK size allocation; added 150ms delay before spawning mc
- **Split view: text selection broken** — `GestureClick` handler no longer claims clicks on `VteTerminal` widgets

#### RDP
- **Crash on RDP connect (RefCell already borrowed)** — the IronRDP event polling loop held an immutable `client_ref.borrow()` while `handle_ironrdp_error` attempted `client_ref.borrow_mut().take()`, causing a double-borrow panic; error handling is now deferred until after the borrow is dropped ([#57](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/57))
- **Crash on RDP connect (ironrdp-tokio panic)** — upstream bug in `ironrdp-tokio 0.8.0` causes `copy_from_slice` panic on 64-bit systems during KDC TCP response parsing; `connect_finalize` is now wrapped in `catch_unwind` so the panic is converted to an error and the GUI falls back to FreeRDP instead of crashing
- **RDP gateway ignored in embedded mode** — IronRDP doesn't support RD Gateway; now falls back to external xfreerdp with a toast ([#53](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/53))
- **External RDP sidebar icon stays green after tab close** — fixed session ID / connection ID mismatch in `add_embedded_session_tab`; external xfreerdp process is now killed on tab close

#### SSH
- **Custom options format unclear** — subtitle now reads "Key=Value, comma-separated" with an example placeholder so users don't have to guess the format ([#58](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/58))
- **`UserKnownHostsFile` defaults to Flatpak path on native build** — `is_flatpak()` now requires `FLATPAK_ID` to match our app ID, preventing false positives when the env var leaks from another Flatpak process ([#59](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/59))

#### Terminal
- **Ctrl+W closes tab instead of deleting word** — changed close-tab shortcut from Ctrl+W to Ctrl+Shift+W (GNOME standard); Ctrl+W now passes through to the shell for backward-kill-word; close-pane moved to Ctrl+Shift+X ([#60](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/60))

#### UI / Clippy
- **Default window size too small on first start** — minimum size increased to 800×500; welcome screen adapts to narrow windows ([#55](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/55))
- **CSS parser warning: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)`** — GTK4 CSS parser requires explicit value; changed to `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
- **Clippy: `RdpCommand::Connect` large enum variant** — boxed `RdpConfig` payload to reduce enum size from 240 to 16 bytes
- **Clippy: case-sensitive `.rdp` extension check** — now uses `Path::extension()` with `eq_ignore_ascii_case`
- **Clippy: collapsible `if` and `if-not-else`** — cleaned up nested conditionals in protocols, window, and main modules

### Changed
- **GTK4/libadwaita/VTE crate upgrade** — gtk4 0.10→0.11, libadwaita 0.8→0.9, vte4 0.9→0.10; unlocks GNOME 48–50 APIs
- **MSRV bumped to 1.92** — required by updated GTK-rs bindings
- **Flatpak runtime bumped to GNOME 50** — all three manifests now use `org.gnome.Platform` 50 with VTE 0.80
- **AdwSpinner migration** — replaces `gtk::Spinner` in export dialog; cfg-gated `adw-1-6`
- **AdwShortcutsDialog migration** — replaces deprecated `gtk::ShortcutsWindow`; cfg-gated `adw-1-8`
- **AdwSwitchRow migration** — replaces manual `ActionRow` + `Switch` in monitoring, logging, and secrets settings tabs
- **AdwWrapBox for protocol filters** — sidebar filters wrap on narrow sidebars; cfg-gated `adw-1-7` with `GtkBox` fallback
- **Welcome screen refreshed** — updated feature highlights, replaced performance internals with Quick Access tips, added Command Palette / Import / Settings shortcuts
- **CSS `prefers-reduced-motion`** — transitions disabled when reduced motion is requested
- **Tiered distro feature flags** — `adw-1-8` for Tumbleweed/Fedora 43+, `adw-1-6` for Leap 16.0/Fedora 42, baseline for older distros
- **Codebase cleanup** — removed 25+ unused CSS classes, consolidated `futures-util` into `futures`, fixed metainfo.xml duplicates, added k8s keywords, removed dead code

- clap 4.5.60→4.6.0, gtk4 0.11.0→0.11.1, gdk4 0.11.0→0.11.1, gsk4 0.11.0→0.11.1, glib 0.22.2→0.22.3, openssl 0.10.75→0.10.76, tracing-subscriber 0.3.22→0.3.23
- Transitive: anstream 0.6.21→1.0.0, anstyle 1.0.13→1.0.14, anstyle-parse 0.2.7→1.0.0, cc 1.2.56→1.2.57, clap_complete 4.5.66→4.6.0, clap_mangen 0.2.31→0.2.33, colorchoice 1.0.4→1.0.5, glib-sys 0.22.0→0.22.3, once_cell 1.21.3→1.21.4, roff 0.2.2→1.1.0, tinyvec 1.10.0→1.11.0, uds_windows 1.2.0→1.2.1

## [0.9.15] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Hide local cursor option for embedded viewers** — new "Show Local Cursor" checkbox in RDP, VNC, and SPICE connection dialogs (Features section) allows hiding the local OS cursor over embedded viewers to eliminate the "double cursor" effect; enabled by default for backward compatibility ([#51](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/51))

### Fixed
- **VNC session ignores Display Mode setting** — the "Display Mode" dropdown (Embedded/External/Fullscreen) in the Advanced tab was saved correctly but had no effect on VNC sessions; now Fullscreen maximizes the main window (same as RDP), and External forces the external VNC viewer (TigerVNC/vncviewer) instead of the embedded vnc-rs client ([#50](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/50))
- **SSH port forwarding via UI broken** — `window/protocols.rs` built SSH args manually, skipping `port_forwards`, X11 forwarding (`-X`), compression (`-C`), and `ControlPersist=10m` from `SshConfig`; refactored to delegate to `SshConfig::build_command_args()` which has the complete logic ([#49](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/49))
- **SSH custom options `-o` prefix not stripped** — `parse_custom_options()` expected `Key=Value` format but users pasted `-o Key=Value` from CLI; now silently strips the `-o` prefix ([#49](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/49))
- **SSH custom options placeholder misleading** — dialog showed `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` format but parser expected comma-separated `Key=Value`; updated placeholder and subtitle to clarify correct format ([#49](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/49))

## [0.9.14] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **SSH connection fails in Flatpak on KDE** — host `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable (e.g. `ksshaskpass`) was inherited by the VTE child process but not available inside the sandbox, causing `Permission denied` before the password prompt appeared; now stripped from the terminal environment since RustConn uses native VTE password injection ([#48](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/48))
- **Header bar buttons clipped when sidebar + monitoring enabled** — monitoring bar's system info label could request more width than available in the content area, causing overflow that pushed header bar buttons out of bounds; fixed by adding `ellipsize` to variable-length labels and `overflow: hidden` on the monitoring bar container ([#47](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/47))

- tokio 1.49→1.50, uuid 1.21→1.22, regex 1.11→1.12, proptest 1.9→1.10, tempfile 3.23→3.26, zip 8.1→8.2, criterion 0.8.1→0.8.2, rpassword 7.3→7.4
- Transitive: hybrid-array 0.4.7→0.4.8, image 0.25.9→0.25.10, libc 0.2.182→0.2.183, libz-sys 1.1.24→1.1.25, moxcms 0.7.11→0.8.1, quinn-proto 0.11.13→0.11.14, schannel 0.1.28→0.1.29, zerocopy 0.8.40→0.8.42

## [0.9.13] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **RDP handshake timeout on loaded servers** — Phase 3 (TLS upgrade + NLA + connect_finalize) now wrapped in `tokio::time::timeout` with `timeout_secs × 2` (minimum 60s); previously only TCP connect had a timeout, causing indefinite hangs when the remote server was under heavy load
- **ARM64 binary download mismatch** — `download_url_for_arch()` on aarch64 no longer falls back to x86_64 URL when no ARM64 binary exists; `get_available_components()` now filters out components unavailable for the current architecture (affects TigerVNC Viewer and Bitwarden CLI)

### Added
- **RDP Quick Actions menu** — new dropdown button on the embedded RDP toolbar with 6 Windows admin shortcuts: Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), Settings (Win+I), PowerShell, CMD, Event Viewer, Services; actions send scancode sequences via `SendKeySequence` command with 30ms inter-key delay

## [0.9.12] - 2026-03-08

### Security
- **Removed sshpass dependency** — interactive SSH sessions now use native VTE password injection via `feed_child()`; monitoring SSH uses `SSH_ASKPASS` mechanism with temporary script instead of `SSHPASS` environment variable (no longer visible in `/proc/PID/environ`)
- **Bitwarden master password zeroized on drop** — `unlock_vault()` now wraps the temporary plain-text password copy in `Zeroizing<String>` so heap memory is scrubbed when the blocking task completes
- **SSH monitoring askpass script cleaned up on drop** — temporary `SSH_ASKPASS` helper script is now deleted automatically when the monitoring session ends (RAII wrapper with `Drop` impl)

### Improved
- **Reduced state.rs complexity** — extracted vault operations (~979 lines) into `vault_ops.rs`, trimming `state.rs` from 3143 to 2167 lines
- **Reduced window/mod.rs complexity** — extracted `setup_edit_actions` (637 lines), `setup_terminal_actions` (298 lines), and `setup_split_view_actions` (746 lines) into separate modules, trimming `window/mod.rs` from 5316 to 3648 lines

### Changed
- **SPICE embedded client enabled by default** — `spice-embedded` feature flag now included in default features for both `rustconn-core` and `rustconn` crates; native SPICE client (via `spice-client` crate) is now the primary connection method with `remote-viewer` as fallback

### Removed
- **sshpass** — removed from all packaging manifests (Flatpak, Flathub, Debian, OBS RPM, Snap); no longer a runtime dependency

## [0.9.11] - 2026-03-07

### Security
- **Bitwarden session key now uses SecretString** — session key was stored as plain `String` in memory without zeroization; migrated to `SecretString` with `expose_secret()` only at CLI invocation point
- **Config files written with 0600 permissions** — connection data (hostnames, usernames, port forwards) was world-readable on multi-user systems; config directory now created with 0700
- **SSH monitoring host key verification** — removed unconditional `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`; now uses `accept-new` by default (accepts first-seen keys, rejects changed keys)
- **Session log sanitization active by default** — built-in sensitive patterns (password prompts, API keys, tokens) were defined but never wired into the sanitizer; now active in `SanitizeConfig::default()`
- **Flatpak device permissions documented** — `--device=all` retained in Flatpak manifests with justification comment (serial ports for picocom require it; Flatpak has no granular `--device=serial` option)
- **Monitoring password uses SecretString** — `ssh_exec_factory` password parameter migrated from plain `String` to `SecretString` with zeroization; `expose_secret()` used only at `SSHPASS` env var injection point
- **RDP TLS certificate policy documented** — `establish_connection` now documents that IronRDP does not validate server certificates (standard for RDP self-signed certs); added `tracing::warn!` on each connection

### Fixed
- **Encrypted document format ambiguity** — legacy salt byte could be misinterpreted as encryption strength byte (~1.2% chance); introduced V2 magic header `RCDB_EN2` for unambiguous format detection

### Added
- **Monitoring: remote host private IP** — monitoring bar now shows the primary private IP address in the system info section; hovering shows hostname, all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses grouped separately
- **Monitoring: live uptime counter** — uptime in the system info tooltip now updates on every metrics polling tick instead of remaining static until the next full system info refresh
- **Monitoring: stopped indication** — when the metrics collector stops (3 consecutive failures), the monitoring bar dims to 50% opacity, shows a warning icon, and the tooltip displays "⚠ Monitoring stopped"
- **Monitoring: all mount points** — disk section now shows root filesystem in the level bar and all mounted real filesystems in the tooltip (mount point, used/total, percentage); virtual filesystems (tmpfs, devtmpfs, squashfs, overlay) and snap loop mounts are filtered out

### Removed
- **Dead `read_import_file_async`** — unused async import helper removed from `rustconn-core/src/import/traits.rs`

## [0.9.10] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Connection dialog Basic tab clipped** — removed redundant outer `ScrolledWindow` wrapping the `ViewStack`; each tab already provides its own scroller, so the nested scroll stole height allocation and clipped the Basic tab content
- **Dialog minimum sizes missing** — added `set_size_request` to Import, Export, and Shortcuts dialogs to prevent UI breakage on small screens
- **Remmina import fails in Flatpak** — importer now also checks the host path `~/.local/share/remmina/` when running inside Flatpak sandbox ([#44](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/44))

### Improved
- **Connection dialog default height** — increased from 500→670px so the Basic tab fields (including Description) are fully visible without scrolling on typical displays

- serde_yaml_ng 0.9→0.10, cfg-expr 0.20.6→0.20.7, inotify 0.11.0→0.11.1, socket2 0.6.2→0.6.3, toml 1.0.4→1.0.6
- CLI downloads: Teleport 18.7.1→18.7.2

## [0.9.9] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **sshpass not installed in Flatpak** — SSH password-authenticated connections broken in Flatpak 0.9.8 ([#42](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/42))
- **Jump host connections fail port check** — pre-connect TCP probe always timed out for destinations reachable only through a jump host; now skipped when `jump_host_id` or `proxy_jump` is configured ([#41](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/41))
- **Jump host dropdown hard to use** — added host address to dropdown labels (`Name (host)`) and enabled search filtering for quick lookup
- **Jump host monitoring fails** — monitoring SSH commands now include `-J` jump host chain so metrics collection works through bastion hosts ([#41](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/41))
- **Jump host false positive connection status** — SSH status detection now checks terminal text for failure patterns (`Connection timed out`, `Connection refused`, etc.) before marking jump host connections as established ([#41](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/41))

- Bitwarden CLI 2026.1.0→2026.2.0, uuid 1.21.0→1.22.0, winnow 0.7.14→0.7.15

## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-05

### Security
- **RDP password no longer exposed on command line** — FreeRDP fallback now uses `/from-stdin` instead of `/p:{password}` argument

### Fixed
- **SSH connection status not turning green** — VTE cursor position axes were swapped; status detection callbacks were skipped when async port check is enabled
- **Automation cursor tracking** — expect-script automation read wrong cursor axis from VTE
- **RDP keyboard input duplication** — deduplicated key press/release handlers via shared `send_ironrdp_key()`
- **Username placeholder on empty `$USER`** — falls back to `$LOGNAME`, then generic placeholder

### Added

**Connection dialog — protocol improvements:**
- **SSH** — password source validation on save, key source "Default" explanation, custom options placeholder, port forwarding duplicate detection
- **RDP** — gateway port/username fields, disable NLA checkbox, clipboard sharing toggle, dynamic resolution info
- **VNC** — encoding dropdown (Auto/Tight/ZRLE/Hextile/Raw/CopyRect), performance mode auto-sync, auth info
- **SPICE** — proxy field for Proxmox VE, CA certificate validation, TLS/skip-verification sensitivity logic
- **Serial** — device auto-detection (`/dev/ttyUSB*`, `/dev/ttyACM*`, `/dev/ttyS*`), dialout group warning
- **Kubernetes** — pod name validation, busybox mode sensitivity
- **Telnet** — plaintext transmission security warning
- **Zero Trust** — CLI availability check, OCI Bastion SSH key/TTL fields, generic command placeholder docs

**Connection dialog — general:**
- Domain field hidden for non-RDP protocols
- MAC address format validation for Wake-on-LAN
- Granular per-connection logging options (activity, input, output, timestamps)
- Password source ↔ SSH auth method auto-sync

**Other:**
- **SFTP mc in split view** — mc-based SFTP sessions now support horizontal/vertical split like SSH
- **Context menu "New Connection"** — opens dialog with the connection's group pre-selected

### Improved
- **Connection dialog decomposition** — extracted 4 tab modules from monolithic `dialog.rs` (~7500→~1500 lines)
- **Embedded RDP decomposition** — extracted 5 modules from monolithic `mod.rs` (~2900→~500 lines)
- **Code quality** — structured tracing fields, i18n coverage, deduplication of clipboard/callback/resize patterns, module-level lint allows removed

- binrw 0.15.0→0.15.1, proc-macro-crate 3.4.0→3.5.0, toml 1.0.3→1.0.4, toml_edit 0.23.10→0.25.4, uds_windows 1.1.0→1.2.0

## [0.9.7] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Connection group not saved** — connection dialog used a separate `Rc` for `groups_data` in the save closure vs the struct field, so `set_groups()` updated the struct but the save handler always read the initial `[(None, "(Root)")]`; connections now correctly land in the selected subgroup on both create and edit ([#40](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/40))
- **Secret variable values lost after settings reopen** — secret variables had their values cleared before persisting to disk (stored in vault), but were never restored from vault when reopening the Variables dialog or substituting `${VAR}` in connections; added `resolve_global_variables()` that loads secret values from the configured vault backend
- **Crash on session reconnect** — `close_tab` held an immutable borrow on `sessions` while `tab_view.close_page()` synchronously fired the `close-page` signal handler which needed a mutable borrow, causing a `BorrowMutError` panic; separated the borrow from the close call ([#39](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/39))

### Changed
- **Bitwarden credential lookup speed** — removed per-retrieve `bw sync` (network round-trip) and added a 120-second verification cache for `bw status` checks; vault syncs once on unlock instead of on every credential lookup, making reconnect and batch operations significantly faster

- tokio 1.49→1.50, aws-lc-rs 1.16.0→1.16.1, aws-lc-sys 0.37.1→0.38.0, getrandom 0.4.1→0.4.2, ipnet 2.11→2.12, quote 1.0.44→1.0.45, tokio-macros 2.6.0→2.6.1, zip 8.1→8.2

## [0.9.6] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Bitwarden Flatpak session key** — `build_command` now falls back to the global in-process session store when the instance-level key is absent, so `SecretManager.is_available()` correctly sees an unlocked vault after `auto_unlock` ([#28](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/28))
- **Bitwarden Settings auto-unlock path** — secrets tab auto-unlock now uses `get_bw_cmd()` (globally resolved path) instead of the local `Rc<RefCell>` which may still hold the bare `"bw"` before detection completes
- **Connection dialog credential download** — lookup key now uses `generate_store_key()` (UUID-based) instead of `"{name} ({protocol})"` format, matching the key used by Bitwarden/1Password/Passbolt store operations
- **Vault credential resolve for non-KeePass backends** — `resolve_credentials_blocking` now has a direct `PasswordSource::Vault` block that calls `dispatch_vault_op` with `auto_unlock` for Bitwarden and other backends, instead of falling through to `CredentialResolver` which created a fresh `BitwardenBackend` without session
- **Inherit condition for non-KeePass backends** — group password inheritance no longer blocked when `kdbx_enabled=true` but preferred backend is Bitwarden/1Password/Passbolt/Pass; condition changed from `!kdbx_enabled` to `!matches!(preferred_backend, KeePassXc | KdbxFile)`
- **Group password load from any backend** — group edit dialog password load button now dispatches to the configured default secret backend via `select_backend_for_load` + `dispatch_vault_op`, instead of hardcoded KeePass/Keyring-only branches
- **SSH known_hosts not persisting in Flatpak** — SSH connections now use `-o UserKnownHostsFile=~/.var/app/<app-id>/.ssh/known_hosts` in Flatpak sandbox where `~/.ssh` is mounted read-only; directory is auto-created; applies to interactive SSH, sshpass, Quick Connect, and monitoring; respects user-set `UserKnownHostsFile` in custom options
- **Duplicate reconnect banner** — `TerminalNotebook` now tracks shown reconnect banners per session to prevent duplicates on repeated child-exit signals
- **SSH dialog key fields for Keyboard Interactive** — auth method visibility now correctly hides key path/passphrase fields for Keyboard Interactive (index 2), same as Password (index 0)

### Changed
- **Dependency updates** — moka 0.12.13→0.12.14, pxfm 0.1.27→0.1.28, zlib-rs 0.6.2→0.6.3; kubectl pinned 1.35.1→1.35.2

## [0.9.5] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **SSH/Telnet pre-connect port check** — fail fast with retry toast instead of hanging in "Connecting" state
- **Vault credential lifecycle** — orphaned credentials cleaned on trash empty; paste duplicates credentials; group rename/move migrates KeePass entries
- **Consistent credential keys** — unified `generate_store_key()` across all backends; fixed silent lookup failures from key format mismatch
- **SecretManager cache TTL** — entries expire after 5 minutes, preventing stale credentials
- **Inherit cycle protection** — `HashSet<Uuid>` visited guard prevents infinite loops in group hierarchy
- **Group change in connection dialog** — selecting a different group now correctly persists on save
- **Monitoring race condition** — waits for SSH handshake before opening monitoring channel

### Security
- **SecretString migration** — RDP/SPICE event credentials, GUI password structs, CLI input, and `Variable` (zeroize on Drop) all use `SecretString`

### Changed
- **Backend dispatch consolidation** — `VaultOp` enum + `dispatch_vault_op()` replaces ~200 lines of duplicated match blocks
- **Mutex lock safety** — ~50 `unwrap()` on `Mutex::lock()` replaced with `lock_or_log()` helper
- **Error logging** — `let _ =` on persistence ops replaced with `tracing::warn!`; remaining `eprintln!` migrated
- **CSS extraction** — 595-line inline CSS moved to `rustconn/assets/style.css`
- **i18n consistency** — hardcoded English strings wrapped with `i18n()` / `i18n_f()`
- **CI** — `--all-features` added to test jobs for feature-gated code coverage

### Removed
- Dead code: `StateAccessError`, unused state accessors, legacy dialog tabs, ~30 unused sidebar methods

- js-sys 0.3.90→0.3.91, pin-project-lite 0.2.16→0.2.17, wasm-bindgen 0.2.113→0.2.114, web-sys 0.3.90→0.3.91
## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Session Reconnect** — disconnected VTE tabs show a "Reconnect" banner to re-launch in one click
- **Recursive Group Delete** — three-option dialog: keep children, cascade delete, or cancel
- **Connection History** — search/filter by name/host/protocol; per-entry delete
- **Cluster from sidebar** — "Create Cluster" pre-selects checked connections
- **Shortcut conflict detection** — warning when a keybinding is already assigned
- **Settings Backup/Restore** — export/import all config as ZIP via Settings → Interface
- **Libvirt / GNOME Boxes import** — VNC, SPICE, RDP from domain XML; auto-scans qemu dirs ([#38](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/38))
- **Automation templates** — 5 built-in expect rule presets (Sudo, SSH Host Key, Login, etc.)
- **TemplateManager** — centralized template CRUD with search, protocol filtering, import/export
- **Snippet shell safety** — warns about dangerous metacharacters in variable values before `--execute`

### Fixed
- **Password inheritance** — `PasswordSource::Variable` now resolved in group hierarchy ([#37](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/37))
- **New connection in wrong group** — context menu now pre-selects the target group ([#37](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/37))
- **Toast system** — severity icons, "Retry" on port-check failures, `AlertDialog` fallback, i18n
- **VTE spawn failure** — missing command shows "Command not found" banner + error toast instead of silent empty terminal
- **Cluster broadcast** — keyboard input now actually broadcasts to all cluster terminals; session lifecycle wired; disconnect-all button; full i18n
- **Pango markup** — escaped ampersand in "Backup & Restore" settings title
- **Adwaita dark theme warning** — suppressed on KDE/XFCE desktops

### Improved
- **User Guide** — major rewrite: Zero Trust, Security, FAQ, Migration Guide, expanded all sections
- **Automation engine** — one-shot rules, per-rule timeout, regex validation, template picker, pre-connect/post-disconnect tasks, key sequences on connect
- **Template management** — CLI and GUI migrated to `TemplateManager`; GUI keeps document integration

- **Updated**: js-sys 0.3.90→0.3.91, pin-project-lite 0.2.16→0.2.17, wasm-bindgen 0.2.113→0.2.114, web-sys 0.3.90→0.3.91
## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Waypipe Support** — Wayland application forwarding for SSH connections via `waypipe`; auto-detected on Wayland sessions when `waypipe` binary is available on PATH; per-connection toggle in SSH Session options; graceful fallback to direct SSH when unavailable ([#36](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/36))
- **IronRDP Clipboard Integration** — Bidirectional clipboard sync between local desktop and remote RDP session via cliprdr channel; server→client text is auto-synced to local GTK clipboard; local clipboard changes are automatically announced to the server; Copy/Paste buttons remain as manual fallback; feedback loop prevention via suppression flag

### Fixed
- **Missing icons on KDE and non-GNOME desktops** — Replaced all non-standard icon names (`emblem-ok-symbolic`, `emblem-system-symbolic`, `call-start-symbolic`, `modem-symbolic`, `application-x-executable-symbolic`, etc.) with freedesktop-standard equivalents; replaced icons missing from Adwaita (`emblem-default-symbolic`, `emblem-synchronizing-symbolic`, `utilities-system-monitor-symbolic`, `view-sidebar-start-symbolic`, `tag-symbolic`) with available alternatives; forced Adwaita icon theme via `GtkSettings` for consistent icon availability on all desktops; unified protocol icons via single source of truth in `icons.rs`, eliminating hardcoded duplicates across sidebar, tabs, dialogs, templates, and cluster views ([#35](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/35))
- **Serial connection creation failed** — Serial and Kubernetes connections no longer require host/port validation (they use device path / pod name instead); previously "Host cannot be empty" error blocked saving these connections
- **Serial/Kubernetes missing client toast** — Shows user-friendly toast when picocom (Serial) or kubectl (Kubernetes) is not installed, and when Kubernetes pod/container configuration is incomplete; fixed toast overlay discovery that failed on `adw::ApplicationWindow` internal widget hierarchy
- **libsecret password storage panic** — Fixed `debug_assert` crash in libsecret backend that rejected non-UUID lookup keys (e.g. `"test (vnc)"`); libsecret uses `name (protocol)` format, not UUIDs
- **libsecret password retrieval** — Fixed `is_available()` check that always returned `false` because `secret-tool --version` is not a valid subcommand (exits with code 2); the store path bypassed this check but the retrieve path went through `SecretManager` which skipped the backend, causing saved passwords to never be found on connection
- **VNC/RDP identical icons** — VNC now uses `video-joined-displays-symbolic` (two monitors) instead of `video-display-symbolic` which was identical to RDP's `computer-symbolic` in Adwaita
- **SFTP via mc opens root instead of home** — mc FISH VFS URI now includes `/~` suffix to open the remote user's home directory; mc is launched via `sh -c` wrapper for correct terminal sizing
- **SSH agent not inherited by VTE terminals** — `spawn_command` now injects `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`/`SSH_AGENT_PID` from the global `OnceLock<SshAgentInfo>` into VTE-spawned processes; previously mc, ssh, and other terminal commands could not reach the SSH agent when RustConn started its own agent (Rust 2024 edition forbids `set_var`)

### Improved
- **Client Detection** — Added waypipe to Settings → Clients detection tab
- **Documentation** — Added Waypipe section to User Guide and Architecture docs
- **Translations** — Added waypipe-related strings to all 18 languages

- **Updated**: deflate64 0.1.10→0.1.11, dispatch2 0.3.0→0.3.1, objc2 0.6.3→0.6.4, zerocopy 0.8.39→0.8.40

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Custom Icons** — Set emoji/unicode or GTK icon names on connections and groups ([#23](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/23))
- **Remote Monitoring** — MobaXterm-style monitoring bar below SSH/Telnet/K8s terminals showing CPU, memory, disk, and network usage from remote Linux hosts; agentless via `/proc/*` parsing; per-connection and global toggle in Settings ([#26](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/26))

### Fixed
- New connections and groups now append to end of list instead of jumping to position 0
- **IronRDP fallback to FreeRDP** — When IronRDP fails during RDP protocol negotiation (e.g. xrdp `ServerDemandActive` incompatibility), the session now auto-falls back to external FreeRDP instead of showing a raw error; shows a user-friendly toast on fallback ([#33](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/33))
- **Monitoring SSH password auth** — Remote monitoring now works with password-authenticated SSH connections via `sshpass`; previously `BatchMode=yes` blocked password auth causing "Permission denied" errors
- **Monitoring error spam** — Monitoring collector now stops after 3 consecutive failures instead of retrying indefinitely and flooding logs
- **Bitwarden CLI not found in Flatpak** — All `bw` command invocations now use a dynamically resolved path instead of hardcoded `"bw"`; `resolve_bw_cmd()` probes Flatpak CLI dir, Snap, `/usr/local/bin`, and `PATH` at startup ([#28](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/28))

### Improved
- **Documentation** — Added User Guide sections for Remote Monitoring and Custom Icons; added monitoring architecture to ARCHITECTURE.md; updated README features table; rewrote Settings section to match the current 4-page `PreferencesDialog` layout (Terminal, Interface, Secrets, Connection); fixed all cross-references to old tab names throughout User Guide; added `docs/BITWARDEN_SETUP.md` step-by-step guide covering Flatpak sandbox, self-hosted servers, API key auth, and troubleshooting
- **Translations** — Completed all 14 language translations to 100% coverage (de, fr, es, it, pl, cs, sk, da, sv, nl, pt, be, kk, uz); added Uzbek (uz) as a new language; fixed corrupted .po file formatting from previous patching

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Command Palette** — VS Code-style quick launcher (`Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) with fuzzy search for connections and `>` / `@` / `#` prefixes for commands, tags, and groups
- **Favorites / Pinning** — Pin connections to a dedicated "Favorites" section at the top of the sidebar via context menu
- **Pass (passwordstore.org) secret backend** — Store and retrieve credentials via `pass` with GPG-encrypted files, custom `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR`, Settings UI, and CLI support ([#32](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/pull/32), contributed by [@h3nnes](https://github.com/h3nnes))
- **Tab coloring by protocol** — Optional colored circle indicator on terminal tabs (SSH=green, RDP=blue, VNC=purple, SPICE=orange, Serial=yellow, K8s=cyan); toggle in Settings → Appearance
- **Snippet timestamps** — `created_at` and `updated_at` fields on `Snippet` model with backward-compatible deserialization
- **Tab grouping** — Right-click context menu on tabs to assign named groups ("Production", "Staging") with color-coded indicators
- **Custom Keybindings** — Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts via Settings → Keybindings with 30+ actions, Record button, per-shortcut Reset, and Reset All

### Fixed
- Command Palette not dismissible via Escape or click-outside
- Favorites group not updating immediately on pin/unpin
- KDBX group visibility regression when loading saved backend preference in Settings
- Doc-comment misplacement in `state.rs` for Pass helper functions

### Improved
- **i18n coverage** — Connection dialog tabs (Basic, Protocol, Data, Logging, Automation, Advanced) and all their content strings now translatable; translations added to all 14 languages
- **User Guide** — Added "Terminal Keybinding Modes" section (vim/emacs in Bash, Zsh, Fish)

- **Updated**: uuid 1.11→1.21, proptest 1.6→1.9, tempfile 3.15→3.23, plus 18 transitive dependency bumps via `cargo update`
### Internal
- Deduplicated `PassBackend` construction in CLI and GUI
- Cached `has_secret_backend()` result in `AppState` to avoid repeated `block_on` calls

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Startup action** — configure which session opens automatically when RustConn starts: local shell, or any saved connection. Set in Settings → Appearance → Startup, or override via CLI flags `--shell` / `--connect <name|uuid>` ([#30](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/30))

### Security
- All password fields (`FreeRdpConfig`, `RdpConfig`, `SpiceClientConfig`, `KdbxEntry`, `PasswordDialogResult`, `ConnectionDialogResult`) migrated to `SecretString` — credentials are now exposed only at point of use
- FreeRDP embedded thread no longer passes password via CLI arg — uses `/from-stdin` + stdin pipe
- Bitwarden `BW_SESSION` replaced with thread-safe in-process `RwLock` storage instead of `set_var`
- KDBX functions migrated to `SecretString` + `SecretResult` throughout
- SSH `custom_options` now filtered against dangerous directives (`ProxyCommand`, `LocalCommand`, etc.) before passing to `ssh -o`
- Hand-rolled base64 in Bitwarden backend replaced with `data-encoding` crate

### Improved
- **Ukrainian translation** — 674 translations professionally reviewed by Mykola Zubkov for accuracy and modern orthography
- SVG icon optimized and simplified per GNOME HIG; 48×48 and 64×64 PNG removed — GTK renders SVG at any size; 128×128 and 256×256 PNG regenerated from SVG
- Welcome page logo now uses GTK themed icon lookup (same as About dialog) — renders SVG at native HiDPI resolution instead of fixed-size raster
- Flathub metainfo.xml overhauled: description condensed, brand colors improved, screenshots replaced with HiDPI windowed captures with shadows, localized screenshots for uk/be/cs, added translate and contribute URLs
- 8 dialogs migrated to `adw::Dialog` (libadwaita 1.5+) with adaptive sizing and proper modal behavior
- Password field uses `PasswordEntry` with built-in peek icon
- Screen reader support: accessible label relations added to password and connection dialogs
- `adw::Clamp` added to dialogs to prevent content stretching on wide screens
- Dialog header bar pattern deduplicated via shared `dialog_header()` helper
- Clear History now requires confirmation via `adw::AlertDialog`
- Search history popover items are now clickable
- All `eprintln!` calls replaced with structured `tracing`

### Fixed
- **VNC RSA-AES auto-fallback** — servers using RSA-AES security type (type 129, e.g. wayvnc) now automatically fall back to external VNC viewer (TigerVNC) instead of showing a raw error. User sees a friendly toast message ([#31](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/31))
- Embedded RDP cursor size corrected on HiDPI displays — server-sent device-pixel bitmaps now downscaled to logical pixels before GTK cursor creation
- Pango markup warning on welcome page — ampersand in "Embedded & external clients" escaped for GTK label rendering
- Variable password source (`PasswordSource::Variable`) now resolves correctly at connection time — `SecretManager` is initialized with backends from settings, and variable lookup uses the same backend as save
- Locale `.mo` files now included in Debian, RPM, and local Flatpak packages
- Debian build no longer enables `spice-embedded` feature without build dependencies
- AppStream metainfo.xml: categories added explicitly (`Network`, `RemoteAccess`), generic `GTK` category removed
- Debian `Recommends` updated for FreeRDP 3 / Wayland support
- Build dependencies corrected for `gettext` across Debian and RPM

### Removed
- Dead code cleanup: unused credential caching, split view adapter methods, toast helpers, deprecated flatpak host command functions

- **Updated**: deranged 0.5.6→0.5.8, js-sys 0.3.86→0.3.88, wasm-bindgen 0.2.109→0.2.111, wasm-bindgen-futures 0.4.59→0.4.61, web-sys 0.3.86→0.3.88
### Internal
- `Project-Id-Version` updated to `0.9.0` in all `.po` files
- Duplicate `SessionResult` type alias removed from `session/manager.rs` — canonical definition in `error.rs`
- Tray stub no longer allocates orphaned `mpsc` channel when `tray` feature is disabled
- Migrated to Rust 2024 edition (167 files changed across all three crates):
  - Eliminated all `unsafe` `set_var`/`remove_var` calls — SSH agent info stored in `OnceLock<SshAgentInfo>` with `apply_agent_env()` helper, language switching via process re-exec with sentinel guard, Bitwarden session token in `RwLock`
  - Renamed `gen` keyword usages to `generator`/`pw_gen`/`counter` in password generator, dialog, and RDP modules
  - Fixed `ref` binding patterns in match arms across source and test files (Rust 2024 match ergonomics)
  - Hundreds of `collapsible_if` patterns rewritten as let-chains (`if let ... && let ...`)
  - Import ordering updated to Rust 2024 `style_edition` rules via `cargo fmt`

## [0.8.9] - 2026-02-20

### Security
- Input validation hardening across all protocols — `custom_args`, device paths, shell paths, hostnames, proxy URLs, and shared folder names are now validated against injection attacks (null bytes, newlines, shell metacharacters, path traversal)
- SSH config export blocks dangerous directives (`ProxyCommand`, `LocalCommand`, etc.) with inline comments
- KeePassXC socket responses capped at 10 MB; reduced password exposure lifetime
- Async import enforces the same 50 MB file size limit as sync path
- VNC and RDP client passwords migrated to `SecretString` — exposed only at point of use
- FreeRDP external launcher uses `/from-stdin` instead of `/p:{password}` on command line

### Added
- **SSH port forwarding** — Local (`-L`), remote (`-R`), and dynamic SOCKS (`-D`) port forwarding rules can be configured per connection; rules are persisted in `SshConfig.port_forwards` and passed as CLI flags to `ssh` ([#22](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/22))
- **Deferred secret backend initialization** — Bitwarden vault unlock and KDBX password decryption now run asynchronously after the main window is presented, eliminating the 1–3 second startup delay when a secret backend is configured

### Fixed
- `localhost` no longer rejected as placeholder during import
- Bitwarden: fixed duplicate vault writes, false "unlocked" status at startup, auto-unlock after restart, and compatibility with CLI v2026.1.0 including automatic `logout → login → unlock` recovery on "key type mismatch" ([#28](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/28))
- Bitwarden GUI unlock no longer clears password field, preventing stale encrypted password on next save ([#28](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/28))
- Generic ZeroTrust `custom_args` now embedded into shell command instead of passed as positional parameters
- RefCell borrow panic in EmbeddedRdpWidget; VNC polling mutex contention; RDP polling timer leak
- FreeRDP now uses native Wayland backend (removed `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` override)
- Several `unwrap()` panics replaced with safe fallbacks (VNC, TaskExecutor, tray, build.rs)
- EmbeddedRdpWidget resize signal handler properly cleaned up on disconnect
- Quick connect RDP fails with "Got empty identity" CredSSP error — NLA is now auto-disabled when username or password is not provided, letting the server prompt for credentials ([#29](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/29))
- Bitwarden vault unlock moved to a background thread — eliminates "application not responding" dialog on startup when Bitwarden is the configured secret backend

### Changed
- **CLI downloads** — Tailscale 1.94.1→1.94.2, Teleport 18.6.8→18.7.0, kubectl 1.35.0→1.35.1
- **Documentation** — Updated README, ARCHITECTURE, and USER_GUIDE with SSH port forwarding and deferred secret backend initialization

### Improved
- ~40 `eprintln!` calls migrated to structured `tracing` across GUI crate
- VNC client warns about unencrypted connections

### Internal
- `tracing` moved to workspace dependencies; deprecated flatpak re-exports removed
- API surface migrated from flat re-exports to modular paths (`rustconn_core::models::*`, etc.)
- Architecture audit: 51 findings, 49 resolved

- **serde_yaml** replaced with **serde_yaml_ng** 0.9 (maintained fork; transparent rename)
- **cpal** `0.17.1` → `0.17.3`
- **clap** `4.5.59` → `4.5.60`

## [0.8.8] - 2026-02-18

### Security
- **AES-256-GCM for stored credentials** — Replaced XOR obfuscation with AES-256-GCM + Argon2id key derivation for KeePassXC, Bitwarden, 1Password, and Passbolt passwords in settings; transparent migration from legacy format on first save
- **FreeRDP password via stdin** — Passwords are now passed using `/from-stdin` instead of `/p:{password}` command-line argument, preventing exposure via `/proc/PID/cmdline`

### Changed
- **FreeRDP detection unified** — Single `detect_best_freerdp()` function with Wayland-first candidate ordering (`wlfreerdp3` → `wlfreerdp` → `xfreerdp3` → `xfreerdp`); all detection paths delegate to it
- **RDP `build_args()` decoupled** — New `build_args()` and `build_command_with_binary()` methods on `RdpProtocol` separate argument construction from binary name; callers determine the binary via runtime detection
- **ZeroTrust validation** — Provider-specific `validate()` on `ZeroTrustConfig` checks required fields (AWS SSM target, GCP IAP instance/zone/project, Teleport cluster, Tailscale hostname, Generic command template) before save
- **ZeroTrust CLI detection** — CLI tool availability (`aws`, `gcloud`, `tsh`, `tailscale`) is verified before connection launch; missing tools show a toast and log a warning
- **ZeroTrust tracing** — Connection launch attempts and failures are now logged via `tracing` in both GUI and CLI paths
- **Native export format v2** — `NativeExport` now includes `snippets` field; backward-compatible with v1 imports via `#[serde(default)]`

- **native-tls** `0.2.14` → `0.2.18` — Removed version pin; 0.2.18 fixes the `Tlsv13` compile error from 0.2.17 ([#367](https://github.com/rust-native-tls/rust-native-tls/issues/367))
- **toml** `0.8` → `1.0` — Major version bump; no API changes required (re-export crate, fully compatible)
- **zip** `2.2` → `8.1` — Major version bump; replaced deprecated `mangled_name()` with `enclosed_name()` which adds path traversal validation
### Fixed
- **RDP HiDPI scaling on 4K displays** — IronRDP now sends `desktop_scale_factor` to the Windows server (e.g. 200% on a 2× display), so remote UI elements render at the correct logical size instead of appearing tiny; previously hardcoded to 0
- **RDP mouse coordinate mismatch on HiDPI** — Widget dimensions used for mouse→RDP coordinate transform now store CSS pixels (matching GTK event coordinates) instead of device pixels, fixing misaligned clicks on scaled displays
### Removed
- **Dashboard module** — Removed unused `ConnectionDashboard` GUI widget, core types (`SessionStats`, `DashboardFilter`), and property tests; session monitoring is handled by Active Sessions manager and sidebar indicators
- **5 dead GUI modules** — Removed `adaptive_tabs.rs`, `empty_state.rs`, `error_display.rs`, `floating_controls.rs`, `loading.rs` (all replaced by native adw/GTK4 equivalents)
- **`tab_split_manager` remnants** — Removed unused field from `MainWindow` and `SharedTabSplitManager` type alias; split view fully handled by `SplitViewBridge`

## [0.8.7] - 2026-02-17

### Security
- **Variable injection prevention** — All variable substitution in command-building paths now validates resolved values, rejecting null bytes, newlines, and control characters to prevent command injection
- **Checksum policy for CLI downloads** — Replaced placeholder SHA256 strings with `ChecksumPolicy` enum (`Static`, `SkipLatest`, `None`) for explicit integrity verification
- **Sensitive CLI arguments masked** — Password-like arguments (`/p:`, `--password`, `token=`, etc.) are masked in log output
- **Configurable document encryption** — `EncryptionStrength` enum (Standard/High/Maximum) with per-level Argon2 parameters; backward-compatible with legacy format
- **SSH Agent passphrase handling** — `add_key()` now uses `SSH_ASKPASS` helper script with `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force` to securely pass passphrases to `ssh-add` without PTY; temporary script is cleaned up immediately after use

### Added
- **Internationalization (i18n)** — gettext support via `gettext-rs` with system libintl; `i18n` module with `i18n()`, `i18n_f()`, `ni18n()` helpers; translations for 14 languages: uk, de, fr, es, it, pl, cs, sk, da, sv, nl, pt, be, kk; closes [#17](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/17)
- **SPICE proxy support** — `SpiceConfig.proxy` field stores proxy URL from virt-viewer `.vv` imports; `remote-viewer` receives `--spice-proxy` flag for Proxmox VE tunnelled connections; fixes [#18](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/18)
- **RDP HiDPI fix** — IronRDP embedded client now multiplies widget dimensions by `scale_factor()` to negotiate device-pixel resolution on HiDPI displays, eliminating blurry upscaling; fixes [#16](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/16)
- **Property tests for variable injection** — 8 proptest properties validating command injection prevention
- **CLI delete confirmation** — Interactive prompt with `--force` flag to skip
- **CLI `--verbose` / `--quiet`** — Global flags for controlling output verbosity
- **CLI `--no-color` / `NO_COLOR`** — Per [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) convention

- **CLI `--dry-run` for connect** — Prints command without executing
- **CLI pager for long output** — Pipes through `less` when output exceeds 40 lines
- **CLI auto-JSON when piped** — List commands switch to JSON when stdout is not a terminal
- **CLI fuzzy suggestions** — "Did you mean: x, y, z?" on connection name mismatch
- **CLI man page generation** — `man-page` subcommand via `clap_mangen`
- **Ctrl+M "Move to Group"** — Keyboard shortcut for moving sidebar items between groups
- **Search history navigation** — Up/Down arrows cycle through sidebar search history
- **CI version check workflow** — Weekly GitHub Action checks upstream CLI versions
- **Client detection caching** — 5-minute cache for CLI version checks
- **Flathub x-checker-data** — Automated dependency tracking for vte, libsecret, inetutils, picocom, mc
- **Flathub device metadata** — `<requires>`, `<recommends>`, `<supports>` in metainfo.xml

### Fixed
- **CLI `--config` flag** — Was declared but never used; now threads through all 43 `ConfigManager` call sites
- **Flatpak components dialog** — Hides unusable protocol clients in sandbox; shows only network-compatible tools
- **SPDX license** — `GPL-3.0+` → `GPL-3.0-or-later` in metainfo.xml

### Changed
- **VTE** — Flatpak manifests use VTE 0.78.7 (LTS branch for GNOME 46/47); `vte4` Rust crate 0.9 with `v0_72` feature
- **CLI modularized** — Split 5000+ line `main.rs` into 18 handler modules
- **CLI structured logging** — `tracing` replaces `eprintln!` with `--verbose`/`--quiet` control
- **VNC viewer list deduplicated** — Single `VNC_VIEWERS` constant shared across detection
- **Protocol icon mapping unified** — `get_protocol_icon_by_name()` in core replaces duplicate match blocks
- **Protocol command building unified** — `Protocol::build_command()` trait; CLI delegates to `ProtocolRegistry`
- **Send Text dialog** — Migrated to `adw::Dialog` per GNOME HIG
- **Sidebar minimum width** — Reduced from 200px to 160px
- **Tray polling optimized** — Split into 50ms message handling + 2s state sync with dirty-flag tracking

### Deprecated
- **Flatpak host command functions** — `host_command()`, `host_has_command()`, etc. in `flatpak.rs`; `flatpak-spawn --host` disabled since 0.7.7

### Improved
- **Accessible labels** — Added to 20+ icon-only buttons for screen reader compatibility
- **Czech translation (cs)** — Native speaker review by [p-bo](https://github.com/p-bo); 45 translations improved ([PR #19](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/pull/19))
- **Remmina RDP import** — Now imports `gateway_server`, `gateway_username`, and `domain` fields from Remmina RDP profiles ([#20](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/20))

## [0.8.6] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- **Embedded RDP keyboard layout** — Fixed incorrect key mapping for non-US keyboard layouts (e.g. German QWERTZ) in IronRDP embedded client ([#15](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/15))
- **Secrets management** — Comprehensive fixes to vault credential storage, backend dispatch, and Bitwarden integration ([#14](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/14)):
  - All vault operations now respect `Settings → Secrets → preferred_backend` instead of being hardcoded to libsecret
  - Bitwarden encrypted password is decrypted and vault auto-unlocked at startup when preferred backend is Bitwarden
  - `PasswordSource::Inherit` resolves group passwords through non-KeePass backends with correct hierarchy traversal
  - RDP and VNC password prompts auto-save entered passwords to vault when `password_source == Vault`

- **Settings Clients Tab Performance** — Parallelized CLI detection; ~15s → ~3s
- **Settings Dialog Visual Render Blocking** — Replaced `glib::spawn_future` with `std::thread::spawn` + `glib::idle_add_local`

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Shared Keyring Module** — Generic `store()`, `lookup()`, `clear()` for all secret backends
- **Keyring Support for All Backends** — Bitwarden, 1Password, Passbolt, KeePassXC
- **Auto-Load Credentials from Keyring** — Automatic restore on settings load
- **Flatpak `secret-tool` Support** — `libsecret` 0.21.7 as Flatpak build module
- **Passbolt Server URL Setting** — New field in `SecretSettings`
- **Unified Credential Save Options** — Consistent "Save password" / "Save to keyring" across all backends

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Passbolt Secret Backend** — Passbolt password manager integration ([#6](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/6)):
  - `PassboltBackend` implementing `SecretBackend` trait via `go-passbolt-cli`
  - Store, retrieve, and delete credentials as Passbolt resources
  - CLI detection and version display in Settings → Secrets
  - Server configuration status check (configured/not configured/auth failed)
  - `PasswordSource::Passbolt` option in connection dialog password source dropdown
  - `SecretBackendType::Passbolt` option in settings backend selector
  - Credential resolution and rename support in `CredentialResolver`
  - Requires `passbolt configure` CLI setup before use

### Changed
- **Unified Secret Backends** — Replaced individual `PasswordSource` variants (KeePass, Keyring, Bitwarden, OnePassword, Passbolt) with single `Vault` variant:
  - Connection dialog password source dropdown: Prompt, Vault, Variable, Inherit, None
  - Serde aliases preserve backward compatibility with existing configs
  - `PasswordSource` is now `Clone` only (no longer `Copy`) due to `Variable(String)`
- **Variable Password Source** — New `PasswordSource::Variable(String)` reads credentials from a named secret global variable:
  - Connection dialog shows variable dropdown when "Variable" is selected
  - Dropdown populated with secret global variables only
- **Variables Dialog Improvements** — Show/Hide and Load from Vault buttons for secret variables:
  - Toggle password visibility with `view-reveal-symbolic`/`view-conceal-symbolic` icon
  - Load secret value from vault with key `rustconn/var/{name}`
  - Secret variable values auto-saved to vault on dialog save, cleared from settings file

### Fixed
- **Secret Variable Vault Backend** — Fixed secret variables always using libsecret instead of configured backend:
  - Save/load secret variable values now respects Settings → Secrets backend (KeePassXC, libsecret)
  - Added `save_variable_to_vault()` and `load_variable_from_vault()` functions using settings snapshot
  - Toast notification on vault save/load failure with message to check Settings
- **Variable Dropdown Empty in Connection Dialog** — Fixed Variable dropdown showing "(Немає)" when editing connections:
  - `set_global_variables()` was never called when creating/editing connections
  - Added call to all three `ConnectionDialog` creation sites (new, edit, template)
  - Edit dialog: `set_global_variables()` called before `set_connection()` so variable selection works
- **Telnet Backspace/Delete Key Handling** — Fixed keyboard settings not working correctly for Telnet connections ([#5](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/5)):
  - Replaced `stty erase` shell wrapper approach with VTE native `EraseBinding` API
  - Backspace/Delete settings now applied directly on the VTE terminal widget before process spawn
  - `Automatic` mode uses VTE defaults (termios for Backspace, VT220 `\e[3~` for Delete)
  - `Backspace (^H)` sends ASCII `0x08`, `Delete (^?)` sends ASCII `0x7F` as expected
  - Fixes Delete key showing `3~` escape artifacts on servers that don't support VT220 sequences
- **Split View Panel Sizing** — Fixed left panel shrinking when splitting vertically then horizontally:
  - Use model's fractional position (0.0–1.0) instead of hardcoded `size / 2` for divider placement
  - Disable `shrink_start_child`/`shrink_end_child` to prevent panels from collapsing below minimum size
  - One-shot position initialization via `connect_map` prevents repeated resets on widget remap
  - Save user-dragged divider positions back to the model via `connect_notify_local("position")`
  - Each split now correctly divides the current panel in half without affecting other panels

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Telnet Backspace/Delete Configuration** — Configurable keyboard behavior for Telnet connections ([#5](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/5)):

  - Connection dialog Keyboard group with two dropdowns for Backspace and Delete key behavior
  - `stty erase` shell wrapper in `spawn_telnet()` to apply key settings before connecting
  - Addresses common backspace/delete inversion issue reported by users
- **Flatpak Telnet Support** — GNU inetutils built as Flatpak module:
  - `telnet` binary available at `/app/bin/` in Flatpak sandbox
  - Built from inetutils 2.7 source with `--disable-servers` (client tools only)
  - Added to all three Flatpak manifests (flatpak, flatpak-local, flathub)

### Changed
- **Dependencies** — Updated: `libc` 0.2.180→0.2.181, `tempfile` 3.24.0→3.25.0, `unicode-ident` 1.0.22→1.0.23

### Fixed
- **OBS Screenshot Display** — Updated `_service` revision from `v0.5.3` to current version tag for proper AppStream metadata processing on software.opensuse.org
- **Flatpak AWS CLI** — Replaced `awscliv2` pip package (Docker wrapper) with official AWS CLI v2 binary installer from `awscli.amazonaws.com`; `aws --version` now shows real AWS CLI instead of Docker error
- **Flatpak Component Detection** — Fixed SSM Plugin, Azure CLI, and OCI CLI showing as "Not installed" after installation:
  - Added explicit search paths for SSM Plugin (`usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin/bin`) and AWS CLI (`v2/current/bin`)
  - Increased recursive binary search depth from 3 to 5/6 levels
- **Flatpak Python Version** — Wrapper scripts for pip-installed CLIs (Azure CLI, OCI CLI) now dynamically detect Python version instead of hardcoding `python3.13`

## [0.7.9] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Telnet Protocol Support** — Full Telnet protocol implementation across all crates ([#5](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/5)):
  - Core model: `TelnetConfig`, `ProtocolType::Telnet`, `ProtocolConfig::Telnet` with configurable host, port (default 23), and extra arguments
  - Protocol trait implementation with external `telnet` client
  - Import support: Remmina, Asbru, MobaXterm, RDM importers recognize Telnet connections
  - Export support: Remmina, Asbru, MobaXterm exporters write Telnet connections
  - CLI: `rustconn-cli telnet` subcommand with `--host`, `--port`, `--extra-args` options
  - GUI: Connection dialog with Telnet-specific configuration tab
  - Template dialog: Telnet protocol option with default port 23
  - Sidebar: Telnet filter button with `network-wired-symbolic` icon
  - Terminal: `spawn_telnet()` method for launching telnet sessions
  - Quick Connect: Telnet protocol option in quick connect bar
  - Cluster dialog: Telnet connections selectable for cluster membership
  - Property tests: All existing property tests updated with Telnet coverage

### Fixed
- **Sidebar Icon Missing** — Added missing `"telnet"` mapping in sidebar `get_protocol_icon()` function; Telnet connections now display the correct icon in the connection tree
- **Telnet Icon Mismatch** — Changed Telnet protocol icon from `network-wired-symbolic` to `call-start-symbolic` across all views (sidebar, filter buttons, dialogs, templates); the previous icon resembled a shield in breeze-dark theme, which was misleading for an insecure protocol
- **ZeroTrust Sidebar Icon** — Unified ZeroTrust sidebar icon to `folder-remote-symbolic` for all providers; previously showed provider-specific icons that were inconsistent with the filter button icon

## [0.7.8] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Remmina Password Import** — Importing from Remmina now automatically transfers saved passwords into the configured secret backend (libsecret, KeePassXC, etc.); connections are marked with `PasswordSource::Keyring` so credentials resolve seamlessly on first connect

### Fixed
- **Import Error Swallowing** — Replaced 14 `.unwrap_or_default()` calls in import dialog with proper error propagation; import failures now display user-friendly messages instead of silently returning empty results
- **MobaXterm Import Double Allocation** — Removed unnecessary `.clone()` on byte buffer during UTF-8 conversion; recovers original bytes from error on fallback path instead of cloning upfront

### Improved
- **Import File Size Guard** — Added 50 MB file size limit check in `read_import_file()` to prevent OOM on accidentally selected large files
- **Native Export Streaming I/O** — `NativeExport::to_file()` now uses `BufWriter` with `serde_json::to_writer_pretty()` instead of serializing entire JSON to `String` first; eliminates intermediate allocation
- **Native Import Streaming I/O** — `NativeExport::from_file()` now uses `BufReader` with `serde_json::from_reader()` instead of reading entire file to `String`; reduces peak memory by ~50%
- **Native Import Version Pre-Check** — Version validation now runs before full deserialization; rejects unsupported format versions without parsing all connections and groups
- **Export File Writing** — Added centralized `write_export_file()` helper with `BufWriter` for consistent buffered writes across all exporters

### Refactored
- **Export Write Consolidation** — Replaced duplicated `fs::write` + error mapping boilerplate in SSH config, Ansible, Remmina, Asbru, Royal TS, and MobaXterm exporters with shared `write_export_file()` helper
- **TOCTOU Elimination** — Removed redundant `path.exists()` checks before file reads in importers; the subsequent `read_import_file()` already returns `ImportError` on failure
- **Unused Imports Cleanup** — Removed unused `ExportError` import from Asbru exporter and moved `std::fs` import to `#[cfg(test)]` in MobaXterm exporter

- Updated `memchr` 2.7.6 → 2.8.0
- Updated `ryu` 1.0.22 → 1.0.23
- Updated `zerocopy` 0.8.38 → 0.8.39
- Updated `zmij` 1.0.19 → 1.0.20
## [0.7.7] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — `Delete`, `Ctrl+E`, and `Ctrl+D` no longer intercept input when VTE terminal or embedded viewers have focus; these shortcuts now only activate from the sidebar ([#4](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/4))

### Improved
- **Thread Safety** — Audio mutex locks use graceful fallback instead of `unwrap()`, preventing potential panics in real-time audio callbacks
- **Thread Safety** — Search engine mutex locks use graceful recovery patterns throughout `DebouncedSearchEngine`
- **Security** — VNC client logs a warning when connection is attempted without a password

### Refactored
- **Runtime Consolidation** — Replaced 23 redundant `tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()` calls across GUI code with shared `with_runtime()` pattern, reducing resource overhead
- **Collection Optimization** — Snippet tag collection uses `flat_map` with `iter().cloned()` instead of `clone()`, and `sort_unstable()` for better performance
- **Dead Code Removal** — Removed 3 deprecated blocking credential methods from `AppState` (`store_credentials`, `retrieve_credentials`, `delete_credentials`)
- **Dead Code Removal** — Removed unused `build_pane_context_menu` from `MainWindow`

## [0.7.6] - 2026-02-07

  - SHA256 checksum verification (except AWS SSM Plugin which uses "latest" URL)
  - Settings → Clients detects CLIs installed via Flatpak Components

- **Snap Strict Confinement** — Migrated from classic to strict confinement:
  - Snap-aware path resolution for data, config, and SSH directories
  - Interface connection detection with user-friendly messages
  - Uses embedded clients (IronRDP, vnc-rs, spice-gtk) — no bundled external CLIs
  - External CLIs accessed from host via `system-files` interface

### Changed

  - Added plugs for ssh-keys, personal-files, system-files
  - Data stored in `~/snap/rustconn/current/`
  - Smaller package (~50 MB) using host-installed binaries

- **Settings → Clients** — Improved client detection display:
  - All protocols (SSH, RDP, VNC, SPICE) show embedded client status
  - Blue indicator (●) for embedded clients, green (✓) for external

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Asbru Import Nested Groups** - Fixed group hierarchy being lost when importing from Asbru-CM:
  - Groups with subgroups (e.g., Group1 containing Group11, Group12, etc.) now correctly preserve parent-child relationships
  - Previously, HashMap iteration order caused child groups to be processed before their parents were added to the UUID map, resulting in orphaned root-level groups
  - Now uses two-pass algorithm: first creates all groups and populates UUID map, then resolves parent references
  - Special Asbru parent keys (`__PAC__EXPORTED__`, `__PAC__ROOT__`) are now properly skipped
- **Asbru Export Description Field** - Fixed description not being exported for connections and groups:
  - Connection description now exports from `connection.description` field directly
  - Falls back to legacy `desc:` tags only if description field is empty

  - Edit Group dialog now includes Description text area for viewing/editing
  - New Group dialog now includes Description text area (unified with Edit Group)
- **Asbru Global Variable Conversion** - Asbru-CM global variable syntax is now converted during import:
  - `<GV:VAR_NAME>` is automatically converted to RustConn syntax `${VAR_NAME}`
  - Applies to username field (e.g., `<GV:US_Parrallels_User>` → `${US_Parrallels_User}`)
  - Plain usernames remain unchanged
- **Variable Substitution at Connection Time** - Global variables are now resolved when connecting:
  - `${VAR_NAME}` in host and username fields are replaced with variable values
  - Works for SSH, RDP, VNC, and SPICE connections
  - Variables are defined in Settings → Variables

### Changed
- **Export Dialog** - Added informational message about credential storage:
  - New info row explains that passwords are stored in password manager and not exported by default

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- RDP clipboard file transfer support (`CF_HDROP` format):
  - `ClipboardFileInfo` struct for file metadata (name, size, attributes, timestamps)
  - `ClipboardFileList`, `ClipboardFileContents`, `ClipboardFileSize` events
  - `RequestFileContents` command for requesting file data from server
  - `FileGroupDescriptorW` parsing for Windows file list format (MS-RDPECLIP 2.2.5.2.3.1)
- RDPDR directory change notifications (`ServerDriveNotifyChangeDirectoryRequest`):
  - Basic acknowledgment support (inotify integration pending)
  - `PendingNotification` struct for tracking watch requests
- RDPDR file locking support (`ServerDriveLockControlRequest`):
  - Basic acknowledgment for byte-range lock requests

### Changed
- Audio playback: replaced `Mutex<f32>` with `AtomicU32` for volume control (lock-free audio callback)
- Search engine: optimized fuzzy matching to avoid string allocations (30-40% faster for large lists)
- Credential operations: use thread-local cached tokio runtime instead of creating new one each time

### Fixed
- SSH Agent key discovery now finds all private keys in `~/.ssh/`, not just `id_*` files:
  - Detects `.pem` and `.key` extensions
  - Reads file headers to identify private keys (e.g., `google_compute_engine`)
  - Skips known non-key files (`known_hosts`, `config`, `authorized_keys`)
- Native SPICE protocol embedding using `spice-client` crate 0.2.0 (optional `spice-embedded` feature)
  - Direct framebuffer rendering without external processes
  - Keyboard and mouse input forwarding via Inputs channel
  - Automatic fallback to external viewer (remote-viewer, virt-viewer, spicy) when native fails
  - Note: Clipboard and USB redirection not yet available in native mode (crate limitation)
- Real-time connection status indicators in the sidebar (green/red dots) to show connected/disconnected state
- Support for custom cursors in RDP sessions (server-side cursor updates)
- Full integration of "Expect" automation engine:
  - Regex-based pattern matching on terminal output
  - Automatic response injection
  - Support for "one-shot" triggers
- Terminal improvements:
  - Added context menu (Right-click) with Copy, Paste, and Select All options
  - Added keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+C (Copy) and Ctrl+Shift+V (Paste)
- Refactored `Connection` model to support extensible automation configuration (`AutomationConfig`)

### Changed
- Updated `thiserror` from 1.0 to 2.0 (backwards compatible, no API changes required)
- Note: `picky` remains pinned at `=7.0.0-rc.17` due to sspi 0.16.0 incompatibility with newer versions

### Removed
- Unused FFI mock implementations for RDP and SPICE protocols (`rustconn-core/src/ffi/rdp.rs`, `rustconn-core/src/ffi/spice.rs`)
- Unused RDP and SPICE session widget modules (`rustconn/src/session/rdp.rs`, `rustconn/src/session/spice.rs`)

### Fixed
- Connection status indicator disappearing when closing one of multiple sessions for the same connection (now tracks session count per connection)
- System tray menu intermittently not appearing (reduced lock contention and debounced D-Bus updates)

## [0.4.2] - 2025-12-25

### Fixed

- Applied rustfmt formatting across all crates
- Added Deactivation-Reactivation sequence handling for RDP sessions

### Fixed
