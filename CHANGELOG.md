# Changelog

All notable changes to RustConn will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Split view content disappearing on panel focus switch** — clicking between split panels caused the content to vanish because the click handler called `switch_to_tab()` which navigated the TabView away from the split-owner's tab (where the split widget lives) to the clicked session's placeholder tab; removed the `switch_to_tab()` call — focus is now handled entirely via `set_focused_pane()` and `grab_focus()` ([#101](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/101))
- **Flatpak SFTP mc host key prompt on every connect** — mc FISH uses SSH internally but could not find the Flatpak-writable `known_hosts` file because `~/.ssh` is read-only in the sandbox; now creates a thin SSH wrapper script that injects `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` and the correct `UserKnownHostsFile`, prepended to `$PATH` for the mc process ([#102](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/102))
- **cargo-deny CI failure** — removed deprecated `unlicensed` and `copyleft` keys from `deny.toml` `[licenses]` section (removed in cargo-deny v2, see [PR #611](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/611))
- **cargo-audit CI failure** — added `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` (rsa Marvin Attack) to `[advisories].ignore` in `deny.toml`; transitive dependency via ironrdp/sspi and spice-client with no upstream fix available

### Dependencies
- Bitwarden CLI 2026.3.0 → 2026.4.1 (fixes supply chain attack in 2026.4.0)
- kubectl 1.35.4 → 1.36.0

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Cloud Sync** — synchronize connection configurations between devices and team members through any shared cloud directory (Google Drive, Syncthing, Nextcloud, Dropbox, USB)
  - **Group Sync** — per-group `.rcn` files with Master/Import access model and name-based merge
  - **Simple Sync** — single-file bidirectional sync with UUID-based merge and tombstone deletion tracking
  - **SSH Key Inheritance** — group-level SSH settings (key path, auth method, proxy jump, agent socket) inherited by child connections; `ssh_key_path` remains local-only per device
  - **Credential Resolution UX** — interactive `AdwAlertDialog` prompts when variables or secret backends are missing at connect time
  - **File Watcher** — automatic import on `.rcn` file changes via `notify` crate with 3s debounce
  - **Cloud Sync Settings page** — `AdwPreferencesPage` with sync directory, device name, synced groups, available files, and Simple Sync toggle
  - **Sidebar sync indicators** — `emblem-synchronizing-symbolic` for synced groups, `dialog-warning-symbolic` for errors
  - **Import group UI restrictions** — synced fields read-only, local fields editable, context menu restrictions
  - **CLI sync commands** — `sync status`, `sync list`, `sync export`, `sync import`, `sync now`
- **Accessible labels** — added `update_property` accessible labels to icon-only buttons (password visibility toggle, password load, RDP quick actions)
- **cargo-deny + cargo-audit in CI** — security advisory checks, license allow-list, ban wildcards, source registry restrictions
- **Document dirty badge** — CSS dot indicator replaces text `"• "` prefix for unsaved documents in sidebar
- **Tab Overview** — grid view of all open tabs (GNOME Web-style) via button on the tab bar or **Ctrl+Shift+O**; makes navigating 10+ tabs significantly easier ([#100](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/100))
- **Tab Switcher in Command Palette** — `%` prefix in Command Palette (or **Ctrl+%**) opens fuzzy search across all open tabs; shows protocol and tab group in results ([#100](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/100))
- **Tab Pinning** — right-click a tab → Pin Tab to keep it always visible at the left edge of the tab bar; pinned tabs don't scroll away ([#100](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/100))
- **Custom terminal themes** — create, edit, and delete custom color themes (background, foreground, cursor, full 16-color ANSI palette) from Settings → Terminal → Colors; custom themes are persisted to `~/.config/rustconn/custom_themes.json` and appear alongside built-in themes in the dropdown ([#98](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/98))
- **Group Jump Host dropdown** — group SSH settings now include a Jump Host dropdown (select from existing SSH connections) in addition to the manual ProxyJump text field; stored as `ssh_jump_host_id` with inheritance support via `resolve_ssh_jump_host_id()`

### Improved
- **Tab Overview + Split View architecture** — complete refactoring of the TabView/SplitView architecture so that split layouts live inside TabPages instead of a global container; Tab Overview now renders correct thumbnails for all tabs including split-view tabs without SIGSEGV crashes or blank previews
- **Split view "Select Tab" popover** — the session picker popover in empty split panels now shows color indicators for sessions already displayed in other split views
- **Split view placeholder** — when a session is moved to another tab's split layout, its own tab shows a "Displayed in Split View" status page with a "Go to Split View" button for quick navigation
- **Split color indicators preserved** — switching between tabs no longer clears the colored dot indicators on split-view tabs
- **Group settings: GNOME HIG enable switches** — Default Credentials and SSH Settings sections now use `AdwExpanderRow` with `show_enable_switch(true)`; when disabled, all fields are cleared to `None`, giving clear semantics of "not configured" vs "configured but empty"
- **SSH tunnel password authentication** — SSH tunnels (used by RDP, VNC, SPICE jump host connections) now support password-authenticated jump hosts via `SSH_ASKPASS` mechanism; previously `BatchMode=yes` was unconditional, silently blocking password auth
- **VTE passphrase prompt guard** — VTE password auto-fill now explicitly rejects SSH key passphrase prompts (`"Enter passphrase for key"`) to prevent sending the wrong secret when SSH auth method is PublicKey
- **Connection dialog: protocol-aware Password Source** — Password Source dropdown is now hidden for protocols that don't use stored passwords (Telnet, Serial, MOSH, Kubernetes, Zero Trust); previously visible but non-functional for these protocols
- **Credential Resolution UX fully wired** — `CredentialResolutionResult` enum now drives the connection flow: `VariableMissing` shows the variable setup `AdwAlertDialog` (enter value + select backend → Save & Connect), `BackendNotConfigured` shows the backend missing dialog (Enter Manually / Open Settings), `VaultEntryMissing` falls through to the protocol's password prompt; previously the resolver silently returned `None` on all failure paths
- **Sidebar sync error indicators** — synced groups now show `dialog-warning-symbolic` with error tooltip when the last sync operation failed (e.g. parse error, missing file); previously always showed the generic synced icon regardless of error state
- **Custom themes atomic write** — `custom_themes.json` now uses temp file + rename (atomic write) with `0600` permissions and `tracing::warn` on errors; consistent with sync file write pattern

### Dependencies
- notify 7 (new — file watching for Cloud Sync)
- hostname 0.4 (new — default device name)
- slug 0.1 (new — sync filename generation)
- Tailscale CLI 1.96.4 → 1.96.5
- cc 1.2.60 → 1.2.61, data-encoding 2.10.0 → 2.11.0, hybrid-array 0.4.10 → 0.4.11, libc 0.2.185 → 0.2.186, rustls-pki-types 1.14.0 → 1.14.1

### Fixed
- **System tray SIGSEGV and empty menu** — tray icon menu could randomly appear empty or crash the application with `object_ref: assertion '!object_already_finalized' failed` (SIGSEGV) on startup; root cause was `ksni::Handle::update()` calling `block_on()` on the GTK main thread which deadlocked with the D-Bus service loop competing for the `TrayState` mutex, and conflicted with the application's tokio runtime guard; moved all D-Bus updates to a dedicated `tray-updater` background thread with coalescing `sync_channel(1)`, moved `TrayManager` creation to a `tray-init` background thread, added re-activation guard in `build_ui`, and ensured polling timers stop when the window is finalized
- **Tab Overview SIGSEGV with split-view tabs** — opening Tab Overview when split-view tabs were active caused Pango `size >= 0` assertion failures and crashes because `AdwTabOverview` attempted to snapshot `TabPage` children with 0×0 allocation; refactored to keep `TabView` always visible with per-tab `TabPageContainer` wrappers that guarantee non-zero allocation
- **Tab Overview blank previews** — split-view tabs showed empty thumbnails in Tab Overview because terminals were reparented to a global split container outside `TabView`; terminals now stay inside `TabPage` children at all times
- **Terminal theme reset when Settings dialog is closed** — closing the Settings dialog applied the global terminal color theme to all terminals, overwriting per-connection theme overrides (custom background/foreground/cursor colors); now re-applies connection-specific theme overrides after global settings are applied ([#99](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/99))
- **Pango assertion failure on zero font size** — guarded against `font_size == 0` in terminal configuration and settings collection to prevent `pango_font_description_set_size: assertion 'size >= 0' failed` crashes when the settings dialog returns an invalid value
- **Highlight rules show color instead of hover-only underline** — VTE's `match_add_regex()` only underlines text on mouse hover without color; added a Cairo `DrawingArea` overlay that reads visible terminal text, runs `CompiledHighlightRules::find_matches()` per line, and draws colored background rectangles and foreground underlines in real time; `SourcePattern` now carries `foreground_color`/`background_color` from the rule ([#97](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/97))

## [0.11.7] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Monitoring bar broken after scrollbar addition** — the terminal scrollbar (added in 0.11.6) changed the session container from vertical to horizontal layout, causing the monitoring bar to appear side-by-side with the terminal instead of below it; wrapped the horizontal terminal+scrollbar row in a vertical outer container so the monitoring bar is correctly appended underneath
- **Monitoring collector keeps running in split view** — when a session entered split view the monitoring bar was removed but the SSH exec collector continued polling the remote host every 3 seconds; added `suspend_monitoring`/`resume_monitoring` to `MonitoringCoordinator` that stops the collector on split entry and restarts it (with stored connection params) when the session returns to tab view

### Documentation
- **User Guide restructured** — reorganized USER_GUIDE.md from 41 flat sections (~4000 lines) into 13 logically grouped sections (~2000 lines); protocols, sessions, organization, and productivity tools are now grouped by topic instead of scattered across the document
- **CLI Reference extracted** — moved the full CLI command reference (~700 lines) to a dedicated [CLI_REFERENCE.md](docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md) for easier navigation
- **Zero Trust Providers extracted** — moved all Zero Trust provider documentation (~220 lines) to a dedicated [ZERO_TRUST.md](docs/ZERO_TRUST.md)
- **FAQ and Troubleshooting merged** — combined the previously separate FAQ, Troubleshooting, and Migration Guide sections to reduce duplication

### Dependencies
- clap_mangen 0.2.33 → 0.3.0

## [0.11.6] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Terminal scrollbar** — VTE terminals now display a vertical scrollbar (using a standalone `GtkScrollbar` connected to VTE's `vadjustment`, the same approach as GNOME Terminal); scrollbar is shown by default and can be toggled in Settings → Terminal → Scrolling ([#95](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/95))
- **"Execute Snippet…" in terminal context menu** — right-clicking inside a terminal now shows an "Execute Snippet…" option that opens the snippet picker; follows GNOME HIG (no nested submenus, verb label with ellipsis) ([#95](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/95))

### Fixed
- **Sidebar status stays gray after reconnect** — clicking "Reconnect" on a disconnected SSH/VTE session now immediately sets the sidebar status to "connecting" (yellow) instead of leaving it gray; the status then transitions to "connected" (green) once the session is established ([#96](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/96))
- **Context menu intermittently fails to open on right-click** — reverted sidebar popover from `autohide(true)` back to `autohide(false)` because GTK4's pointer grab consumed right-click events before the gesture handler could fire; added manual Escape key handler and window `focus-widget` tracking to auto-dismiss the menu when a dialog opens ([#87](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/87))

### Dependencies
- pastey 0.2.1 → 0.2.2
- rustls 0.23.38 → 0.23.39

## [0.11.5] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Simplified Chinese (zh-cn) translation** — complete translation of all 1573 UI strings; contributed by GaaChun ([PR #94](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/pull/94))
- **User Guide: libvirt NSS hostname resolution** — added troubleshooting section explaining how to resolve VM hostnames via the libvirt NSS module when connecting with RDP/VNC from Flatpak or native installs ([#91](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/91))

### Dependencies
- picky-asn1-der 0.5.5 → 0.5.6
- rustls-webpki 0.103.12 → 0.103.13
- winnow 1.0.1 → 1.0.2
- kubectl 1.35.3 → 1.35.4

## [0.11.4] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Sidebar flashes red during SSH connection** — connecting via SSH (and other protocols with port check) briefly showed "failed" (red) status before switching to "connected" (green); introduced `ConnectionStartResult` enum to distinguish async port check in progress (`Pending`) from real failures (`Failed`); the sidebar now stays yellow ("connecting") until the port check completes
- **Context menu stays open when dialog opens** — the sidebar context menu remained visible when opening a dialog via keyboard shortcut or toolbar button (e.g. "New Connection"); switched the popover from `autohide(false)` to `autohide(true)` so GTK4 automatically dismisses it when focus moves elsewhere ([#93](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/93))
- **Sidebar stays "connecting" after cancelling password dialog** — closing the VNC or RDP password prompt without entering credentials left the sidebar status stuck on yellow ("connecting"); the status is now cleared on cancel
- **VNC/RDP with "None" password source prompts immediately** — when Password Source is set to "None", the first connection attempt now uses an empty password; the password dialog is only shown on retry (second attempt) if authentication fails
- **Cannot save SSH connection with default key** — validation incorrectly required an explicit SSH key path even when Key Source was set to "Default"; the check now only applies when Key Source is "File"

### Dependencies
- Teleport CLI 18.7.3 → 18.7.4
- 1Password CLI 2.33.1 → 2.34.0

## [0.11.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **CLI: `--jump-host` flag for `add` and `update`** — set a jump host (SSH bastion) when creating or updating SSH, SFTP, RDP, VNC, and SPICE connections via CLI; accepts connection name or UUID; validates that the referenced connection exists and prevents self-referencing
- **SSH Jump Host for VNC and SPICE** — VNC and SPICE connections now support SSH jump host tunnelling via `ssh -L` local port forwarding; the tunnel process is managed automatically and killed on tab close; port check is skipped when jump host is configured
- **SSH tunnel stderr capture** — SSH tunnel process stderr is now read in a background thread and logged via `tracing::warn`; diagnostic messages (auth failures, port unreachable) are available via `SshTunnel::stderr()` and logged on process exit
- **SSH tunnel health monitoring** — `SshTunnel::is_alive()` checks whether the SSH process is still running; `wait_for_tunnel_ready()` now detects early process exit and fails fast with a descriptive error instead of polling until timeout
- **CLI: `show` displays Jump Host** — `rustconn-cli show` now prints the resolved jump host name for SSH, SFTP, RDP, VNC, and SPICE connections

### Fixed
- **RDP via jump host stuck at "connecting"** — embedded IronRDP connections through an SSH tunnel could hang indefinitely when the remote host was unreachable (firewall DROP); the handshake timeout for tunnel connections is now capped at 15 seconds (down from 60s) and produces a clear error message ([#92](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/92))
- **Flatpak: kubectl and Hoop.dev missing from settings and PATH** — kubectl and Hoop.dev CLI were not shown in the Settings → Clients detection tab and their install directories were missing from the Flatpak PATH extension; added "Container Orchestration" section to settings, added Hoop.dev to "Zero Trust Clients", and registered both directories in `get_cli_path_dirs()` and `find_in_flatpak_cli_dir()`
- **Sidebar status not set on connection start** — "connecting" (yellow) status is now shown immediately on double-click, before credential resolution or tunnel creation begins; previously the status only appeared after the tunnel was established
- **Sidebar status not cleared on RDP error** — non-protocol errors (timeout, unreachable host) now fire the `on_state_changed(Error)` callback, which closes the tab and sets "failed" (red) status; previously the sidebar stayed yellow after a timeout
- **Sidebar "failed" status overridden by Disconnected** — the `Disconnected` handler no longer calls `decrement_session_count` for sessions that were never connected; this prevents the "failed" status set by the Error handler from being cleared back to empty
- **RefCell panic on RDP error** — `handle_ironrdp_error` now uses take-invoke-restore pattern for `on_state_changed` and `on_error` callbacks; the previous `borrow()` approach caused a re-entrancy panic when the callback triggered `close_tab` → `adw_tab_view_close_page` → `Disconnected` state change
- **RDP error toast** — a toast notification ("RDP connection failed. Check that the remote host is reachable.") is now shown when an embedded RDP connection fails before ever connecting

### Improved
- **RDP handshake phase logging** — debug log messages now mark each handshake phase (X.224 negotiation, TLS upgrade, NLA/capabilities) so the exact hang point is visible in logs
- **TCP_NODELAY for tunnel connections** — Nagle's algorithm is disabled on the TCP stream to the tunnel, reducing latency for the RDP handshake
- **Tunnel timeout error message** — tunnel connections show "Connection failed: RDP handshake timed out after 15s — the remote host may be unreachable through the SSH tunnel or the RDP service is not running" instead of generic "Operation timed out"

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Reconnect reuses existing tab for all VTE protocols** — clicking "Reconnect" on a disconnected session now respawns the process in the same terminal tab instead of closing and creating a new one; works for SSH, Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes, ZeroTrust (all providers), and MOSH; tab position, tab group, and split view state are fully preserved ([#89](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/89))
- **RDP port check skipped with jump host** — pre-connect TCP port check is now skipped for RDP connections that have a jump host configured; the destination is only reachable through the SSH tunnel, so direct probing always timed out
- **Hoop.dev CLI download** — `releases.hoop.dev` removed the `latest` URL alias (HTTP 403); switched to versioned URL format; pinned to 1.56.1
- **Azure/gcloud/OCI CLI wrapper test in Flatpak** — `az --version` verification after pip install crashed with `Read-only file system`; now sets Flatpak-writable config dirs during wrapper script test
- **Flatpak SFTP always uses mc** — SFTP in Flatpak now always opens via Midnight Commander; `xdg-open sftp://` is unreachable from the sandbox

### Improved
- **Reconnect banner consistent across all protocols** — RDP, VNC, and SPICE sessions now show the "Session disconnected / Reconnect" banner at the bottom of the tab (same position as SSH/Telnet) instead of a button in the top-right toolbar
- **Sidebar width tuned for HiDPI** — default sidebar width lowered from 360px to 320px and fraction from 30% to 27%; saved widths from older versions are reset on upgrade; fixes overly wide sidebar on 4K displays with 200% scaling while keeping all protocol filter icons visible

### Added
- **SSH Jump Host for RDP** — SSH jump host selector is now available for RDP connections; the session is tunnelled through the selected SSH bastion host via `ssh -L` local port forwarding; tunnel process is managed automatically and killed on tab close ([#90](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/90))
- **Tab context menu: Close Others / Left / Right / All / Ungrouped** — right-click a tab for browser-style close actions: close all other tabs, close tabs to the left or right, close all ungrouped tabs, or close all tabs
- **CLI: all protocols and Zero Trust providers** — `rustconn-cli add` now supports all 10 protocols (`ssh`, `rdp`, `vnc`, `spice`, `sftp`, `telnet`, `serial`, `mosh`, `k8s`, `zt`) and all 11 Zero Trust providers with provider-specific flags (`--aws-region`, `--gcp-zone`, `--resource-group`, `--boundary-target`, etc.)

### Documentation
- **Complete CLI reference in User Guide** — comprehensive documentation for all 23 CLI commands with syntax, options tables, examples for every protocol and Zero Trust provider, shell completions, Flatpak usage with alias, and scripting examples

### Dependencies
- open 5.3.3 → 5.3.4
- openssl 0.10.77 → 0.10.78
- openssl-sys 0.9.113 → 0.9.114
- typenum 1.19.0 → 1.20.0
- Hoop.dev CLI pinned to 1.56.1

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Reconnect preserves tab position** — clicking "Reconnect" on a disconnected session now opens the new tab at the same position in the tab bar instead of appending it to the end; fixes workflow disruption when managing 10+ SSH sessions ([#89](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/89))
- **Context menu handoff between items** — right-clicking a second sidebar item while a context menu is already open now correctly closes the first menu and opens the new one; previously the second menu failed to appear due to GTK4 popover lifecycle conflicts ([#87](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/87))
- **Stale highlight on right-click** — right-clicking multiple sidebar items in succession no longer leaves residual selection highlights on previously clicked rows; the context menu gesture now claims the event sequence to prevent GTK4 from applying sticky `:active` / `:focus-within` pseudo-classes to row widgets
- **Context menu requires single right-click** — switching the context menu between sidebar items now works with a single right-click instead of requiring two clicks (first to dismiss, second to open); achieved by disabling `autohide` on the popover and managing dismissal explicitly via gesture handlers

### Improved
- **Context menu layout follows GNOME HIG** — sidebar context menu items reordered to match GNOME Files conventions: primary action (Connect) at top, organisation (Rename / Duplicate / Move) next, utilities (Copy credentials, SFTP, WOL) in the middle, creation and properties (New Connection, Edit) before the destructive action (Delete) at the bottom
- **MSRV bumped to 1.95** — required by `constant_time_eq` 0.4.3 (transitive dependency via `zip`)

### Improved
- **`SshOptionsWidgets` tuple replaced with named struct** — the 24-element tuple type alias in `ssh.rs` is now a proper struct with named fields; adding new SSH options is a single-point change instead of updating ~6 destructuring sites across `dialog.rs`
- **Split view context menu shares popover lifecycle with sidebar** — split view panel right-click menu now uses the same `ACTIVE_POPOVER` tracking as the sidebar; right-clicking panel B while panel A's menu is open correctly closes the first menu; also fixes cross-component conflicts where a sidebar menu and split view menu could fight for the GTK4 popover grab; menu labels now wrapped in `i18n()` for localization
- **Auto-reconnect guard for closed tabs** — polling callback now checks if the session still exists in `sessions_map` before triggering reconnect; prevents creating an orphan tab if the user manually closes the tab while background polling is active
- **SSH config importer applies `Host *` defaults** — `Host *` entries in `~/.ssh/config` are now parsed as global defaults and merged into each host entry (host-specific values take priority); previously `Host *` was skipped entirely, losing settings like `ServerAliveInterval 60` that apply to all hosts

### Added
- **SSH Keep-Alive settings** — dedicated `Keep-Alive Interval` and `Keep-Alive Count` spin rows in the SSH Connection options group; generates `-o ServerAliveInterval=N` and `-o ServerAliveCountMax=M` flags to prevent idle disconnects caused by firewalls or server timeouts; new connections default to 60s interval / 3 retries; custom_options take precedence if the same key is set manually ([#88](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/88))
- **SSH Config import/export for Keep-Alive** — `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` from `~/.ssh/config` are now mapped to dedicated fields instead of only `custom_options`; exporter outputs them as separate directives with deduplication

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **General tab migrated to adw:: widgets** — connection dialog General tab rebuilt with `adw::PreferencesGroup`, `adw::EntryRow`, `adw::SpinRow`, `adw::ComboRow`, and `adw::PasswordEntryRow`; replaces manual Grid+Label+Entry layout with native GNOME HIG sections (Identity, Connection, Authentication, Organization); 30-element tuple replaced with `BasicTabWidgets` struct; content wrapped in `adw::Clamp` (max 600px) for consistent width; Entry suffix widgets constrained with `width_chars`/`max_width_chars`
- **Legacy XOR encryption migration warning** — credentials still using XOR obfuscation are transparently migrated to AES-256-GCM on load; a toast notification shows the count of migrated credentials; XOR support will be removed in v0.12
- **State access helpers** — `with_state()`, `try_with_state()`, `with_state_mut()`, `try_with_state_mut()` helper functions reduce RefCell borrow panics; documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Runtime warning for `block_on_async`** — logs `tracing::warn` when GTK main thread is blocked for >100ms, suggesting `spawn_async` instead
- **Accessible label for Command Palette list** — screen readers now announce the results list as "Search results"
- **Desktop entry translations** — added `Comment[lang]` translations for uk, de, fr, es, cs

### Improved
- **RDP connection state structured** — `handle_ironrdp_error()` 13-parameter signature replaced with `RdpConnectionContext` struct
- **Automation task validation hardened** — import warnings for connections with automation/expect rules; sensitive env vars (`BW_SESSION`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) cleared before task execution
- **Localized constants and port descriptions** — `(Root)`, `(None)`, `(No keys loaded)`, and port range labels (`Well-Known`, `Registered`, `Dynamic`) now wrapped in `i18n()` for translation
- **Sidebar GNOME HIG color consistency** — sidebar pane and tab bar backgrounds unified with `@headerbar_bg_color` for GNOME Files-like appearance; bottom toolbar buttons use `.flat` style; separator between search and list hidden for seamless look; works correctly in both light and dark themes
- **KeePass button visibility** — active vault button now uses normal icon color instead of `.suggested-action` (which rendered white-on-white in light theme); inactive state uses `.dim-label`
- **Focus border only in split view** — `.focused-panel` accent border is now hidden when only one panel exists; previously showed a distracting border around the welcome screen and single-tab sessions

### Fixed
- **Split view tab colors preserved across Settings** — opening the Settings dialog no longer resets colored indicators on split view tabs; the root cause was that `apply_protocol_color()` / `clear_protocol_color()` guards relied on an unpopulated `session_tab_ids` map, so they always overwrote split indicators when `set_color_tabs_by_protocol()` was called on dialog close
- **Group Operations mode no longer breaks sidebar layout** — replaced text buttons with compact icon-only pill buttons matching the protocol filter bar style; toolbar wrapped in animated `Revealer` (SlideDown 200ms) instead of abrupt `set_visible()`; delete button uses `@error_color` for visual distinction
- **Split view context menu Copy/Paste/Select All now works** — action group `terminal.*` was installed on the TabView container which is lost when the terminal is reparented into a split panel; moved to the VTE terminal widget itself so actions follow the widget through reparenting

### Security
- **Automation env var sanitization** — task executor removes sensitive environment variables before spawning shell commands
- **Lazy Bitwarden credential decryption** — Bitwarden master password and API credentials are now decrypted at startup only when Bitwarden is the preferred backend; previously they were unconditionally decrypted into memory even when KeePass or other backends were active

### Dependencies
- libbz2-rs-sys 0.2.2 → 0.2.3
- rand 0.8.5 → 0.8.6
- rtoolbox 0.0.4 → 0.0.5

## [0.10.22] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Terminal context menu Copy/Paste now works** — replaced custom `GestureClick` popover with VTE's native `set_context_menu_model()` API; the old approach broke clipboard actions because the popover stole focus from VTE before callbacks could run ([#84](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/84))
- **No more `gdk_clipboard_write_async` assertion** — Copy action now caches selected text via `text_selected()` before VTE clears the selection on right-click, preventing the `mime_type != NULL` GDK critical warning
- **Blank menus on X11 (MATE, XFCE)** — GTK4's NGL renderer causes popovers to render blank until hovered on some X11 compositors; RustConn now auto-detects X11 sessions and falls back to the Cairo renderer via process re-exec ([#85](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/85))

### Improved
- **Context menu labels localized** — Copy, Paste, Select All strings now wrapped in `i18n()` for translation

### Dependencies
- pxfm 0.1.28 → 0.1.29
- tokio 1.52.0 → 1.52.1
- uuid 1.23.0 → 1.23.1

## [0.10.21] - 2026-04-16

### Security
- **Machine key encryption hardened** — removed predictable `hostname+username` fallback from `get_machine_key()`; `/etc/machine-id` fallback now uses HKDF-SHA256 with app-specific salt; `.machine-key` file created with `0600` permissions

### Fixed
- **Groups expand/collapse on double-click** — double-clicking anywhere on a group row now toggles expand/collapse, not just the expander icon ([#83](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/83))
- **Ctrl+K no longer hijacks terminal** — removed `Ctrl+K` from the global search shortcut; only `Ctrl+F` focuses the search box now, so `Ctrl+K` passes through to terminal applications like nano ([#83](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/83))
- **Right-click context menu on all SSH profiles** — set gesture propagation phase to `Capture` so the right-click handler fires before `TreeExpander` internal handlers that could swallow the event ([#83](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/83))
- **Filter bar opens below search box** — swapped layout order so protocol filters appear below the search entry instead of above it, preventing UI jump ([#83](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/83))

### Improved
- **Sidebar accessible labels localized** — wrapped `"Search connections"`, `"Search syntax help"`, `"Connection list"`, and `"Filter by {protocol} protocol"` in `i18n()` / `i18n_f()` for screen reader localization

### Dependencies
- aws-lc-rs 1.16.2 → 1.16.3
- aws-lc-sys 0.39.1 → 0.40.0
- clap 4.6.0 → 4.6.1

## [0.10.20] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **RDP shared folders only used first folder path** — RDPDR backend now maps each drive to its own base path via `device_id`, so multiple shared folders work correctly in embedded IronRDP mode ([#82](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/82))
- **Tailscale CLI download broken by macOS-only release** — pinned version 1.96.5 only existed for macOS; downgraded to 1.96.4 (latest Linux build) and switched from static checksum to `SkipLatest` policy to prevent future platform-specific release breakage ([#81](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/81))
- **SSH Port Forwarding section missing from connection dialog** — the Port Forwarding group was silently not added because fragile widget tree navigation (`first_child → downcast → child → ...`) failed; now uses the content box directly from `create_ssh_options()` return value ([#80](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/80))

### Docs
- **Flatpak shared folders troubleshooting** — added "RDP Shared Folders in Flatpak" section to User Guide with `flatpak override` commands for granting filesystem access ([#82](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/82))

## [0.10.19] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Shell button in header bar** — moved the Local Shell button from the sidebar filter bar to the main header bar as a prominent accent-colored pill button with icon and label; always visible even when sidebar is hidden ([#76](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/76))
- **Optional protocol filter bar** — protocol filters can now be toggled on/off via a button in the search bar or in Settings → Interface → "Show protocol filters"; state is persisted across sessions; hidden by default for a cleaner interface ([#76](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/76))
- **Toggle protocol filters action** — `win.toggle-protocol-filters` window action with sidebar toggle button that persists visibility state to config
- **Tab group chooser dialog** — "Set Group..." dialog now shows existing groups as clickable pill buttons for quick selection, with a text field for creating new groups; no  manual retyping of group names
- **Close All in Group** — new context menu action on grouped tabs; shows a confirmation dialog with tab count and group name, then closes all tabs belonging to that group
- **Group name in tab tooltip** — hovering over a grouped tab now shows `[GroupName]` in the tooltip, visible even when split view colors are active
- **Group name as tab title prefix** — tab groups now display as a `[GroupName]` prefix in the tab title instead of a colored indicator icon; this separates group identity from split view / protocol color indicators, so both are visible simultaneously

### Fixed
- **Terminal not auto-focused after connection** — newly opened SSH session tabs now automatically grab keyboard focus so the user can type immediately; uses idle callback with selected-page guard to prevent focus-stealing when multiple tabs open concurrently ([#79](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/79))
- **SIGSEGV on rapid right-click on tab** — triple right-clicking a terminal tab caused a segfault because each click created a new popover without unparenting the previous one; now tracks the active popover and tears it down before creating a new one
- **Tray menu labels empty when "Minimize to tray" enabled** — the ksni tray `menu()` callback runs on a D-Bus worker thread where `gettext` is not initialised, causing `i18n()` to return empty strings; tray menu now uses plain English labels to avoid the thread-safety issue; window visibility is synced via periodic polling so the Show/Hide toggle stays correct
- **Tab group color conflict with split view** — tab groups and split view previously competed for the same `indicator_icon` slot; groups now use a title prefix while split view keeps the colored indicator, eliminating the conflict

### Improved
- **Wider sidebar** — increased minimum sidebar width from 160px to 360px for better readability of nested items and long hostnames; increased OverlaySplitView max from 280px to 360px default with up to 600px maximum
- **Filter bar cleanup on hide** — active protocol filters are automatically cleared when the filter bar is hidden to prevent invisible filtering confusion

### Dependencies
- bitflags 2.11.0 → 2.11.1
- clap_complete 4.6.1 → 4.6.2
- FreeRDP 3.24.0 → 3.24.1 (security fixes)

- VTE 0.80.0 → 0.80.3

## [0.10.18] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Terminal font zoom** — dynamically scale terminal font size using Ctrl+Scroll wheel, Ctrl+Plus/Minus keyboard shortcuts, and Ctrl+0 to reset; uses VTE's native `font_scale` for per-session zoom (0.5×–4.0×) ([#77](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/77))
- **Copy on select** — optional X11-style auto-copy: selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard; enable in Settings → Terminal → Behavior ([#78](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/78))

### Improved
- **Export group filter** — export dialog now includes a group selector to export only connections from a specific group and its subgroups; defaults to "All connections"
- **Import/Export format ordering** — RustConn Native (.rcn) is now the default format in both import and export dialogs; remaining formats sorted alphabetically

### Dependencies
- gio 0.22.4 → 0.22.5
- glib 0.22.4 → 0.22.5
- hyper-rustls 0.27.7 → 0.27.8
- libc 0.2.184 → 0.2.185

- pkg-config 0.3.32 → 0.3.33
- rtoolbox 0.0.3 → 0.0.4
- rustls 0.23.37 → 0.23.38

## [0.10.17] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **`clear` command not working in Flatpak SSH sessions** — the Flatpak sandbox inherits `TERM=dumb` from the host, and the previous fix only set `rustconn-256color` for local shells; remote commands (SSH, Telnet, etc.) kept the inherited `dumb` value, breaking `clear`, `htop`, `mc`, `tmux` on remote hosts; now force `TERM=xterm-256color` for all remote commands in Flatpak ([#25](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/25))
- **Sidebar scroll position lost after editing/moving connections** — `restore_state()` scheduled group expansion, scroll restoration, and selection as three independent idle callbacks that raced against each other; scroll was applied before groups finished expanding (which changes content height), causing the sidebar to jump to the top; now runs expansion and selection synchronously in one callback, then restores scroll in a chained second callback
- **Sorting collapsed all expanded groups** — `sort_connections()` and `sort_recent()` rebuilt the sidebar store without saving/restoring expanded group state; now preserves which groups were open before sorting

### Dependencies
- clap_complete 4.6.0 → 4.6.1
- rand 0.9.2 → 0.9.3
- Tailscale CLI 1.96.4 → 1.96.5

## [0.10.16] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Sidebar context menu actions still not working** — the v0.10.15 fix using `insert_action_group()` proxy was insufficient: `PopoverMenu` inside a `ListView`/`TreeExpander` hierarchy cannot reliably resolve `win.*` actions regardless of where the action group is injected; replaced `PopoverMenu` + `gio::Menu` with a plain `Popover` containing `Button` widgets that directly call `window.activate_action()`, completely bypassing GTK4 action-group resolution ([#75](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/75))

### Dependencies
- cc 1.2.59 → 1.2.60
- gif 0.14.1 → 0.14.2
- hashbrown 0.16.1 → 0.17.0
- indexmap 2.13.1 → 2.14.0

- wasm-bindgen 0.2.117 → 0.2.118
- web-sys 0.3.94 → 0.3.95

## [0.10.15] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **`clear` command not working in Flatpak** — the `clear` binary from ncurses-utils was missing inside the Flatpak sandbox; added a minimal ANSI escape sequence wrapper (`\033[H\033[2J\033[3J`) to all three Flatpak manifests so `clear` works out of the box ([#25](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/25))
- **Sidebar context menu items not working** — after migration to `PopoverMenu` in v0.10.14, clicking menu items did nothing because the popover lacked access to the window's action group; fixed by explicitly proxying `win.*` actions into the popover via `insert_action_group()` ([#75](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/75))
- **Keyboard shortcuts dialog showed wrong bindings** — 19 discrepancies between the shortcuts help dialog (`shortcuts.rs`) and the actual GTK accelerators (`keybindings.rs`): Ctrl+G was labeled "New group" (actually Password Generator), Ctrl+T was labeled "Open local shell" (actually Ctrl+Shift+T), Ctrl+\` was labeled "Focus terminal" (actually Focus Next Pane), F1 was labeled "Show about dialog" (actually Keyboard Shortcuts); all corrected to match the real bindings
- **Shortcuts dialog missing entries** — added 13 missing shortcuts: Quick Connect, Export, Command Palette, Focus Terminal, Close Pane, Connection History, Statistics, Password Generator, Wake On LAN, Toggle Fullscreen, Toggle Sidebar, and alternative accelerators

### Improved
- **FreeRDP stays at 3.24.1** — 3.24.2 release assets not yet published upstream; keeping 3.24.1 which includes all prior security fixes

### Documentation
- **Keyboard shortcuts fully synchronized** — User Guide shortcuts tables now match the actual keybindings registry; added missing entries for Ctrl+K (Search), Ctrl+PageDown/PageUp (tab switching), Ctrl+Shift+T (Local Shell), Ctrl+H (History), Ctrl+G (Password Generator), Ctrl+Shift+I (Statistics), Ctrl+Shift+L (Wake On LAN)
- **Terminal clear troubleshooting** — added User Guide section explaining VTE's Ctrl+L behavior (scrolls instead of erasing) and workarounds for `clear` command in Flatpak

## [0.10.14] - 2026-04-09

### Dead code cleanup
- **Removed unused CSS classes** — removed `.tab-icon`, `.tab-label`, `.tab-label-disconnected`, `.tab-close-button` (replaced by AdwTabView), `.focused-pane`/`.unfocused-pane` (replaced by `.focused-panel`), `notebook > header > tabs > tab` selector (no longer using GtkNotebook), and stale comment placeholders; updated section headers for clarity

### Improved
- **Success notifications use Toast instead of modal dialogs** — snippet creation, cluster creation now show non-blocking `adw::Toast` instead of `adw::AlertDialog` (GNOME HIG compliance); remaining `show_success` calls with detailed counts (import/export/delete) kept as alerts
- **Fixed missing i18n for export/connection test dialogs** — `"Export Complete"`, `"Connection Test Successful"`, and `"Connection successful! Latency: Xms"` were hardcoded English; now wrapped in `i18n()`/`i18n_f()` for proper localization
- **Accessible labels for status icons and split panels** — sidebar connection status icons (`Connected`, `Connecting`, `Connection failed`) now use `i18n()` for localized screen reader announcements; split panel containers have accessible `"Terminal panel"` label
- **Sidebar context menus migrated to PopoverMenu** — replaced manual `Button`-based `Popover` with `PopoverMenu` + `gio::Menu` for both connection/group and empty-space context menus; provides native GNOME HIG look, keyboard arrow navigation, and screen reader accessibility out of the box

### Fixed
- **Sidebar context menu missing Delete action** — context menu for both connections and groups was cut off at the bottom, hiding the Delete item; fixed by attaching popover to the clicked widget instead of the window, allowing GTK to properly calculate available space and scroll long menus

### Documentation
- **RDP File Transfer** — added User Guide section documenting shared folders (drive redirection) and clipboard file transfer (IronRDP embedded mode "Save Files" button)
- **Complete translations for all 15 languages** — filled all empty/fuzzy translations for be, cs, da, de, es, fr, it, kk, nl, pl, pt, sk, sv, uk, uz; fixed broken PO headers in 10 files; updated version to 0.10.14

## [0.10.13] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **SSH auto-reconnect infinite loop** — when an SSH session failed with "Permission denied" (exit code 255), the auto-reconnect polling detected the host as online (TCP port open) and immediately triggered a reconnect, which failed again with the same auth error, creating an exponential loop of sessions. Fixed by skipping auto-reconnect for SSH authentication failures (exit code 255); the user can still reconnect manually via the overlay button
- **Duplicate `child-exited` handlers for SSH/Telnet** — `setup_child_exited_handler` was called twice per session (before and after spawn), registering two GLib signal handlers. Each exit event fired both handlers, spawning two parallel auto-reconnect polls per failure cycle and doubling the session count on every iteration

### Dependencies
- FreeRDP 3.24.0 → 3.24.1 (security fix: CVE patches for credential zeroing, codec fixes)
- Boundary CLI 0.21.1 → 0.21.2 (search sorting flags)
- tokio 1.51.0 → 1.51.1, toml_edit 0.25.10 → 0.25.11

## [0.10.12] - 2026-04-07

### Security
- **VNC password stored as `SecretString`** — `VncConfig.password` changed from plain `String` to `secrecy::SecretString`, matching RDP/SSH/SPICE credential handling; password is now zeroized on drop and protected from accidental logging via `Debug` trait
- **VNC pixel buffer max resolution guard** — `VncPixelBuffer::new()` and `resize()` now clamp dimensions to 16384×16384 (1 GB max), preventing OOM from a malicious VNC server claiming absurd resolution

### Improved
- **RDP 4K frame conversion zero-copy** — `convert_to_bgra()` now returns `Cow<[u8]>` instead of `Vec<u8>`; when pixel data is already in BGRA format (the common IronRDP case), the function returns a borrowed slice instead of cloning the entire frame buffer (33 MB at 4K per frame)
- **Sidebar search highlight regex cached** — `highlight_match()` now accepts a pre-compiled `Regex` via new `compile_highlight_regex()` helper; the regex is compiled once per query change instead of once per visible list item per keystroke
- **Log sanitization custom patterns pre-compiled** — `SanitizeConfig` now pre-compiles custom regex patterns at construction time instead of recompiling on every call to `sanitize_output()`; affects every line of terminal output when session logging is enabled
- **Log sanitization redundant `to_lowercase()` removed** — `SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` are already lowercase constants; removed unnecessary `pattern.to_lowercase()` allocation on every pattern comparison

### Dead code cleanup
- **Removed `wayland_surface.rs`** — ~1050-line stub module with no callers; all types (`WaylandSubsurface`, `EmbeddedRenderer`, `ShmBuffer`, `DamageRect`, `RenderingMode`) were unused; native Wayland subsurface support can be restored from git history when needed
- **Removed `TracingOutput::OpenTelemetry` variant** — deprecated placeholder that was never constructed; match arm fell back to stderr
- **Removed RDPDR `FileLock` struct and `notify_directory_change()` stub** — dead code placeholders for unimplemented fcntl integration
- **Removed commented-out code** — `set_allow_bold` (VTE4 incompatible), `--full-screen` SPICE arg

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: fastrand 2.4.0→2.4.1, gdk4 0.11.1→0.11.2, gdk4-sys 0.11.1→0.11.2, gio 0.22.2→0.22.4, glib 0.22.3→0.22.4, gtk4 0.11.1→0.11.2, gtk4-sys 0.11.1→0.11.2, libz-sys 1.1.26→1.1.28, pango 0.22.0→0.22.4, zip 8.5.0→8.5.1
- **CLI downloads** — TigerVNC 1.16.1→1.16.2 (security fix for x0vncserver), Teleport 18.7.2→18.7.3, Bitwarden CLI 2026.2.0→2026.3.0

## [0.10.11] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **RDP Mouse Jiggler** — prevents idle disconnect by sending periodic mouse movements; configurable interval (10–600 seconds, default 60); auto-starts when RDP session connects, auto-stops on disconnect; works with both IronRDP embedded and FreeRDP external modes; settings in Connection Dialog → RDP → Features
- **Connect All in Folder** — right-click a group in the sidebar → "Connect All" opens all connections in that group simultaneously
- **Copy Username / Copy Password from context menu** — right-click a connection → "Copy Username" or "Copy Password" copies credentials to clipboard; password auto-clears from clipboard after 30 seconds for security; uses cached credentials resolved during previous connection
- **Host Online Check** — right-click a connection → "Check if Online" starts async TCP port probing (polls every 5s for up to 2 minutes); auto-connects when host becomes reachable; shows toast notifications for status updates
- **WoL + Auto-Connect** — Wake On LAN now automatically polls the host after sending the magic packet (up to 5 minutes) and auto-connects when the host comes online; replaces the previous fire-and-forget WoL behavior
- **Auto-reconnect on session failure** — when an SSH session disconnects unexpectedly (server reboot, network failure), RustConn automatically starts polling the host (every 5s for up to 5 minutes) and reconnects when the server comes back online; the reconnect banner is still shown for manual reconnect if auto-reconnect times out
- **Host check module** (`rustconn-core::host_check`) — async TCP connect probe with configurable timeout, polling interval, and max duration; cancellation support via `AtomicBool`; `check_host_online()` for single probe, `poll_until_online()` for continuous monitoring
- **Terminal Activity Monitor** — per-session activity and silence detection for terminal tabs, inspired by KDE Konsole ([#72](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/72)); three monitoring modes: Off (default), Activity (notify when new output appears after a configurable quiet period), and Silence (notify when no output occurs for a configurable timeout); notifications delivered through tab indicator icons, in-app toasts, and desktop notifications (when window is unfocused); per-connection config overrides global defaults; settings in Connection Dialog → Advanced → Activity Monitor and Settings → Monitoring → Activity Monitor; tab context menu "Monitor: Off/Activity/Silence" for quick mode cycling; property-based tests for mode cycling, serde round-trip, config resolution, and timeout clamping

### Fixed
- **RDP tabs auto-close on initial connection failure** — RDP tabs that fail during initial connection (CredSSP auth error, connection refused, timeout) now close automatically instead of showing a useless "failed" tab; disconnected tabs are still shown for sessions that were previously connected (for reconnect)
- **Group context menu detection** — fixed `is_group` detection in sidebar context menu to use `ConnectionItem.is_group()` instead of icon name check; groups with custom emoji icons now correctly show group-specific menu items (Connect All, New Connection in Group)

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: fastrand 2.3.0→2.4.0

## [0.10.10] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- **Flatpak: removed extra sandbox permissions rejected by Flathub lint** — reverted `--filesystem=home/.hoop:ro`, `--filesystem=xdg-run/gnupg:ro`, `--filesystem=home/.var/app/com.bitwarden.desktop/data:ro`, and `--filesystem=xdg-run/ssh-agent:ro` from Flatpak and Flathub manifests; these permissions are now added manually by users via `flatpak override` after installation (see [Flatpak Sandbox Overrides](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#flatpak-sandbox-overrides)); prompted by [flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint#972](https://github.com/flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint/pull/972#pullrequestreview-4051168156)

### Added
- **User Guide: Flatpak Sandbox Overrides section** — documents how to add filesystem permissions for alternative SSH agent sockets (KeePassXC, Bitwarden, GPG agent, 1Password) and Hoop.dev CLI config after Flatpak installation ([User Guide → Flatpak Sandbox Overrides](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#flatpak-sandbox-overrides))

### Improved
- **Bulk delete dialog migrated to AdwAlertDialog** — replaced custom `adw::Window` with `adw::AlertDialog` using `set_close_response("cancel")` and `ResponseAppearance::Destructive`, following GNOME HIG for destructive confirmation dialogs
- **Background thread result delivery** — `spawn_blocking_with_callback` now uses event-driven `glib::MainContext::channel()` instead of 16ms polling timer, reducing unnecessary main loop wake-ups
- **vault_ops unit tests** — added 14 tests for `select_backend_for_load` (8 backend selection scenarios including KeePass fallback logic) and `generate_store_key` (6 key format scenarios across LibSecret, Bitwarden, 1Password, Pass backends)

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: cc 1.2.58→1.2.59, coreaudio-rs 0.14.0→0.14.1, indexmap 2.13.0→2.13.1, libz-sys 1.1.25→1.1.26, semver 1.0.27→1.0.28, tokio 1.50.0→1.51.0, tokio-macros 2.6.1→2.7.0, writeable 0.6.2→0.6.3, yuv 0.8.12→0.8.13
- **CLI downloads** — TigerVNC 1.16.0→1.16.1

## [0.10.9] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Hoop.dev Zero Trust provider** — added Hoop.dev as the 11th Zero Trust provider; supports `hoop connect <connection-name>` with optional `--api-url` and `--grpc-url` flags; includes data model (`HoopDevConfig`), CLI detection (`detect_hoop()`), Flatpak CLI download component, GUI fields in connection dialog, CLI support (`--provider hoop_dev --hoop-connection-name`), Flatpak `~/.hoop:ro` permission, serialization round-trip, i18n, and property-based tests
- **Custom SSH agent socket override** — users can now specify a custom `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` path at two levels: a global setting in Settings → SSH Agent tab (applies to all connections) and a per-connection override in Connection Dialog → SSH tab (overrides global and auto-detected socket); resolves the Flatpak limitation where `--socket=ssh-auth` hard-overwrites `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, preventing use of alternative agents like KeePassXC or Bitwarden SSH agent ([#71](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/71))
- **CLI `--ssh-agent-socket`** — `rustconn-cli add` and `update` commands accept `--ssh-agent-socket <PATH>` to set per-connection SSH agent socket; `show` command displays the value when set
- **Socket path validation** — real-time feedback in both Settings and Connection dialogs: green for valid socket, yellow for path not found (non-blocking), red for non-absolute path
- **Flatpak: alternative SSH agent socket access** — added `--filesystem` permissions for GPG agent (`xdg-run/gnupg`), Bitwarden SSH agent (`home/.var/app/com.bitwarden.desktop/data`), and custom sockets (`xdg-run/ssh-agent`) in Flatpak and Flathub manifests

### Fixed
- **Orphaned subgroups on group delete** — deleting a group containing only empty subgroups (0 connections) via the GUI now cascade-deletes all descendant subgroups instead of reparenting them to root; CLI `group delete` now delegates to `ConnectionManager` instead of manual `groups.retain()`, fixing dangling `parent_id` references on child groups
- **Startup error dialog orphaned window** — `show_error_dialog` no longer creates a temporary `ApplicationWindow` that lingers after dismissal; now presents via `app.active_window()` parent

### Security
- **Tar archive path traversal (defense-in-depth)** — CLI component downloads now validate each tar entry path against `..` traversal and absolute paths before extraction, matching the existing `enclosed_name()` protection for zip archives; pinned `tar >= 0.4.45` (CVE-2026-33056)
- **RDP certificate validation** — changed default `ignore_certificate` from `true` to `false`; FreeRDP now uses `/cert:tofu` (trust-on-first-use) by default instead of unconditional `/cert:ignore`; applies to all RDP paths (external FreeRDP, embedded launcher, embedded thread)
- **Bitwarden session key no longer exposed in process list** — session key is now passed via `BW_SESSION` environment variable instead of `--session` CLI argument, preventing exposure in `/proc/PID/cmdline`
- **1Password credentials no longer exposed in process list** — password field values are now piped via stdin instead of passed as CLI arguments to `op item create/edit`
- **Export file permissions hardened** — KDBX XML exports and all connection export files now set `0600` (owner-only) permissions on Unix, preventing world-readable credential/topology data
- **Bitwarden session key cleared on vault lock** — `lock_vault()` now calls `clear_session_key()` alongside `clear_verified()`, ensuring the session key does not persist in memory after lock
- **VNC custom args blocklist** — dangerous VNC viewer arguments (`-via`, `-passwd`, `-passwordfile`, `-securitytypes`, `-proxyserver`, `-listen`) are now blocked, matching the existing RDP custom args blocklist
- **FreeRDP extra args blocklist** — `extra_args` in FreeRDP external mode now filtered through the same dangerous-prefix blocklist (`/p:`, `/password:`, `/shell:`, `/proxy:`) as RDP `custom_args`
- **Pass backend path traversal prevention** — `build_pass_path()` now sanitizes `connection_id` and `field` by replacing `/`, `\`, `.` with `_`, preventing directory traversal in the password store
- **Log sanitization expanded** — added `passphrase:`, `client_secret:`, `authorization:` to sensitive prompt patterns; added GitHub (`ghp_*`), GitLab (`glpat-*`), and JWT (`eyJ*`) token detection to value patterns

### Corrected
- **Flatpak `--device=all` clarification** — v0.9.11 release notes incorrectly stated Flatpak permissions were "scoped to `--device=serial`"; Flatpak has no granular `--device=serial` option — the actual permission is `--device=all`, which is required for serial port access via picocom

### Improved
- **Asbru import regex cached** — `convert_asbru_variables()` now uses `LazyLock<Regex>` instead of compiling the regex on every call, matching the pattern used throughout the rest of the codebase
- **Snippet validation strings translated** — "Snippet name is required" and "Command is required" wrapped in `i18n()` for localization
- **Framebuffer fallback warning** — RDP, VNC, and SPICE embedded viewers now log `tracing::warn!` (once per session) when the legacy `to_vec()` pixel buffer copy path is activated instead of `CairoBackedBuffer`
- **Clippy suppressions scoped to GUI crate** — 8 GTK-specific clippy suppressions (`redundant_clone`, `needless_borrow`, `needless_pass_by_value`, `unused_self`, `wildcard_imports`, `needless_borrows_for_generic_args`, `redundant_closure_for_method_calls`, `redundant_closure`) moved from workspace `Cargo.toml` to `rustconn/Cargo.toml`; `rustconn-core` now linted under stricter rules

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: aws-lc-sys 0.39.0→0.39.1, cc 1.2.57→1.2.58, cmake 0.1.57→0.1.58, hybrid-array 0.4.8→0.4.10, hyper 1.8.1→1.9.0, libc 0.2.183→0.2.184, mio 1.1.1→1.2.0, simd-adler32 0.3.8→0.3.9, system-deps 7.0.7→7.0.8, toml_edit 0.25.8→0.25.10, uuid 1.22.0→1.23.0, winnow 1.0.0→1.0.1, zerocopy 0.8.47→0.8.48, zip 8.4.0→8.5.0, zune-jpeg 0.5.14→0.5.15
- **CLI downloads** — Tailscale 1.96.2→1.96.4

## [0.10.8] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Flatpak: gcloud install fails with read-only filesystem** — `install.sh` now runs with `CLOUDSDK_CONFIG` pointing to the writable sandbox directory, preventing `OSError: [Errno 30]` on `~/.config/gcloud/`

### Improved
- **SPICE/VNC embedded rendering performance** — replaced per-frame `to_vec()` pixel buffer copy with persistent `CairoBackedBuffer` (in-place surface updates + `mark_dirty_rectangle`); eliminates 8–33 MB allocation per frame depending on resolution; same zero-copy pattern already used by embedded RDP since 0.10.7
- **`CairoBackedBuffer` extracted to shared module** — `cairo_buffer.rs` is now used by RDP, VNC, and SPICE embedded widgets instead of three separate implementations
- **`parse_version` regex cached** — `secrets_tab.rs` now reuses `VERSION_REGEX` from `rustconn-core` instead of compiling a new regex on every call
- **`VARIABLE_REGEX` deduplicated** — identical regex was compiled in three modules (`variables/manager.rs`, `snippet/manager.rs`, `utils.rs`); now defined once and re-exported

## [0.10.7] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **RDP default quality mode** — new RDP connections now default to Quality (RemoteFX) instead of Balanced; existing connections with explicitly saved Balanced or Speed settings are not affected

### Fixed
- **SPICE fallback viewer reported as failed** — `connect_with_fallback()` returned an error even when the external SPICE viewer launched successfully; now returns `Ok(())` so the GUI correctly shows the connected state
- **SPICE embedded mouse clicks at wrong position** — click and release events sent coordinates (0,0) instead of the actual cursor position; now applies the same widget-to-framebuffer coordinate transformation as mouse motion
- **RDP file import ignores gateway port** — `.rdp` parser read gateway port from `gatewayaccesstoken` instead of the standard `gatewayport` field; gateway connections now use the correct port
- **Session type misclassified for terminal protocols** — only SSH was classified as embedded; Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes, and MOSH sessions are now correctly classified as terminal-embedded
- **MOSH `--ssh` argument not parsed correctly** — `--ssh=ssh -p PORT` was passed as a single argument; now split into `--ssh` and `ssh -p PORT` as two separate arguments for correct parsing
- **MOSH connections accepted port 0** — `validate_connection()` now rejects port 0, consistent with SSH and other protocols
- **Config file corruption on power failure** — synchronous `save_toml_file` now calls `sync_all()` before atomic rename, matching the async version's durability guarantee
- **CLI `delete` auto-confirms in non-interactive mode** — piped input no longer auto-confirms destructive operations; use `--force` to bypass confirmation in scripts
- **CLI `add` allows duplicate connection names** — now returns an error if a connection with the same name already exists
- **CLI `group delete` leaves orphaned connections** — connections belonging to a deleted group now have their `group_id` cleared
- **CLI `update` uses case-sensitive exact match** — now uses `find_connection` for case-insensitive and fuzzy matching, consistent with other commands
- **FreeRDP 2.x flagged as version-incompatible** — detection entries for `wlfreerdp`/`xfreerdp` (2.x) had `min_version("3.0.0")`; corrected to `"2.0.0"`
- **External window saves default size instead of current** — `setup_close_handler` now uses `window.width()`/`height()` to capture actual dimensions after user resize
- **Cluster dialog buttons break on layout change** — Select All / Deselect All buttons are now stored as struct fields instead of being found via fragile `parent()` traversal
- **Whitespace-only group and snippet names accepted** — `validate_group` and `validate_snippet` now trim names before checking emptiness
- **Tray dirty-check hash collision** — replaced simple timestamp sum with `DefaultHasher` combining connection IDs and timestamps
- **`Connection::default_port` duplicated `ProtocolType::default_port`** — now delegates to `self.protocol.default_port()`

### Security
- **Script credential resolver password not zeroed** — intermediate `String` holding the password from script output is now zeroed via `zeroize::Zeroize` after wrapping in `SecretString`
- **Encrypted credential changes not detected** — `SecretSettings::PartialEq` now includes all `*_encrypted` fields so save-if-changed logic detects credential updates

### Improved
- **Highlight rules performance** — `CompiledHighlightRules` now uses `RegexSet` for fast initial filtering before running individual regexes; avoids executing every pattern on every terminal line
- **Command palette sort performance** — `SearchEngine` is now created once before sorting instead of inside every comparator call
- **GTK main loop polling** — `poll_for_result` uses `timeout_add_local` at 16ms intervals instead of `idle_add_local_once` to avoid busy-spinning
- **Terminal themes cached** — `all_themes()` and `theme_names()` use `OnceLock` to avoid repeated allocation
- **Fuzzy search allocation** — `fuzzy_score_optimized` replaced `to_lowercase()` with allocation-free case-insensitive search
- **Export runs on background thread** — large exports no longer freeze the UI
- **CLI download default allocation** — reduced from 10MB to 1MB for small downloads
- **Group descendant collection** — `collect_descendant_groups` uses `HashSet` for O(1) lookups instead of O(n) `Vec::contains`
- **`parse_args` supports quoted strings** — uses `shell_words::split()` so RDP arguments with spaces and quotes are parsed correctly
- **Tray menu translated** — all tray menu strings wrapped in `i18n()`
- **Password generator tips translated** — security tip strings wrapped in `i18n()`
- **Session restore version validation** — `from_json` now warns on version mismatch for forward compatibility
- **ZeroTrust protocol registry documented** — `get_by_type()` explains that ZeroTrust delegates to provider-specific protocols
- **Wayland subsurface code documented** — dead Wayland native paths annotated as future extension points
- **Duplicate CSS rules removed** — `.status-connected` and `.status-connecting` were defined twice in sidebar CSS
- **Dead Flatpak config helpers removed** — unused `get_flatpak_boundary_config_dir` and `get_flatpak_cloudflared_config_dir`
- **`CredentialResolutionContext` struct** — replaces 8-argument function with a bundled context struct
- **Embedded RDP 4K performance** — replaced per-frame 33MB pixel buffer clone (`data.to_vec()`) with a persistent Cairo `ImageSurface` that is updated in-place via `surface.data()` + `mark_dirty_rectangle()`; eliminates the main bottleneck that caused near-slideshow rendering at 4K resolution; old `PixelBuffer` path kept as fallback for FreeRDP external mode
- **RDP frame extraction optimized** — `extract_region_data` replaced per-pixel copy+swap loop with row-based `memcpy` + bulk R↔B channel swap; full-frame fast path avoids row-by-row copy when region covers entire image; LLVM auto-vectorizes the swap loop into SIMD on x86_64
- **RDP cursor artifacts (random pixels below cursor)** — cursor bitmaps from IronRDP are padded to 32×32 or 64×64 with transparent rows; on HiDPI the downscale + compositor upscale caused color bleeding at transparency edges; now crops transparent padding before downscale and uses premultiplied alpha (`B8g8r8a8Premultiplied`) to prevent bleed; R↔B channel swap moved from session layer to cursor handler to avoid double-swap

## [0.10.6] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Passbolt CLI integration broken with CLI 0.4.2** — `PassboltResourceDetail` deserialization failed because serde looked for `"_id"`, `"_name"`, `"_uri"`, `"_description"` instead of lowercase `"id"`, `"name"`, `"uri"`, `"description"` returned by Passbolt CLI 0.4.2; added `serde(rename)` for all underscore-prefixed fields; made `_id` and `_name` optional since `get resource` no longer returns `id`; added `folder_parent_id` field; same fix applied to `PassboltResource` for `_username` and `_uri` ([#69](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/69))
- **Blurry/artifact RDP image on HiDPI displays** — embedded IronRDP framebuffer was double-scaled on HiDPI (device→CSS→device) because Cairo surface lacked `set_device_scale`; now sets device scale on the pixel buffer surface so Cairo renders 1:1 at native resolution; also uses adaptive filter (Nearest for 1:1, Bilinear for actual scaling)
- **1Password JSON parse errors silently ignored** — `op item list` parse failures were swallowed by `unwrap_or_default()`, masking real issues; now logs warning via `tracing::warn!`

### Changed
- **CLI downloads** — 1Password CLI 2.33.0→2.33.1

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: ipconfig 0.3.2→0.3.4, libredox 0.1.14→0.1.15, proptest 1.10.0→1.11.0

## [0.10.5] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **KeePassXC CLI integration not working** — all vault write/rename/delete/copy operations passed `None` as database password to `keepassxc-cli`, causing "Invalid credentials" errors when the KDBX file is password-protected; now correctly passes `kdbx_password` from settings in all 10 call sites across GUI (`vault_ops.rs`) and CLI (`secret.rs`) ([#68](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/68))
- **KeePassXC CLI silent error swallowing** — `get_password_from_kdbx` silently returned `Ok(None)` for unrecognized errors; `get_password_from_kdbx_with_key` silently skipped failed path attempts; now logs warnings via `tracing::warn!`/`tracing::debug!` for all failure paths
- **KeePassXC CLI missing `-q` flag** — added `-q` (quiet) flag to all `keepassxc-cli show` commands and `verify_kdbx_credentials` to suppress interactive password prompts in scripted usage
- **GTK warnings on application startup** — suppressed `Adwaita-WARNING: gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` on KDE/XFCE by clearing the deprecated property before `adw::init()`; removed unsupported `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` CSS media query that caused GTK theme parser warning

### CI
- **GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation** — replaced `flathub-infra/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@master` (Node.js 20) with `flatpak/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@v6` (Node.js 24)

### Dependencies
- **Updated**: deflate64 0.1.11→0.1.12, toml 1.0.7→1.1.0, zip 8.3.1→8.4.0

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Flatpak: Zero Trust CLIs crash on read-only filesystem** — gcloud, Azure CLI, Teleport, and OCI CLI need writable config directories; Flatpak mounts host dirs as read-only or doesn't mount them at all; now redirects CLI config paths to writable sandbox directories via environment variables (`CLOUDSDK_CONFIG`, `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR`, `TELEPORT_HOME`, `OCI_CLI_CONFIG_FILE`); bootstraps credentials from host mounts where available; Boundary uses system keyring via D-Bus (works natively in Flatpak); Cloudflare Access SSH uses browser-based auth (no persistent config needed); GCP IAP also gets `--ssh-key-file` and `--strict-host-key-checking=no` to handle read-only `~/.ssh/`
- **Flatpak: Zero Trust CLI tools not found** — `is_host_command_available()` used default PATH which doesn't include Flatpak CLI directories (`~/.var/app/.../cli/`); now uses extended PATH from `get_cli_path_dirs()` so AWS SSM, gcloud, and other installed CLIs are detected correctly
- **Failed connections stuck in "connecting" (yellow) state** — when `start_connection()` returned `None` (e.g. missing CLI, validation error), sidebar status was never reset; now transitions to "failed" (red) on connection launch failure
- **VTE runtime warning on regex match registration** — `match_add_regex()` requires `PCRE2_MULTILINE` compile flag; highlight rules and search highlight regexes were compiled with flags=0, causing `_vte_regex_has_multiline_compile_flag` assertion warning

### Improved
- **Flatpak manifests: FreeRDP and Waypipe modules** — added missing `freerdp` module to `packaging/flatpak/io.github.totoshko88.RustConn.yml` and `packaging/flathub/io.github.totoshko88.RustConn.yml`; added missing `waypipe` module to `packaging/flatpak/io.github.totoshko88.RustConn.yml` — matches documentation claim "FreeRDP 3.24.0 bundled in Flatpak"
- **i18n: 3 untranslated UI strings wrapped** — `"Failed to start"` in settings, `"Enter text above to test patterns"` and `"No patterns matched"` in connection dialog highlight rules, `"Import Failed"` in import dialog, `"Pasted {} chars"` in VNC clipboard — all translated across 15 languages
- **Snap license corrected** — `GPL-3.0+` → `GPL-3.0-or-later` (SPDX)
- **ARM64 release builds** — added `build-deb-arm64`, `build-rpm-arm64`, and `build-appimage-arm64` jobs to release workflow using QEMU emulation

- Updated: `moka` 0.12.14→0.12.15, `yuv` 0.8.11→0.8.12
- **CLI downloads** — Tailscale 1.94.2→1.96.2
- **Libvirt daemon import** — new import source "Libvirt Daemon (virsh)" queries running libvirtd for VMs via `virsh dumpxml`, reusing the existing XML parser; supports `qemu:///session`, `qemu:///system`, and remote URIs ([#63](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/63))

## [0.10.3] - 2026-03-21

### Security
- **RDP password no longer exposed in `/proc`** — legacy `RdpLauncher` passed password as `/p:{pass}` CLI argument visible to all system users; now uses `/from-stdin` pipe matching `SafeFreeRdpLauncher` behavior
- **SSH agent askpass script zeroized before deletion** — passphrase temp file in `/tmp/rustconn-askpass-*/` is now overwritten with zeros and fsynced before `remove_dir_all`, preventing recovery after abnormal termination
- **CLI `--password` flag shows security warning** — `rustconn-cli secret set --password` now prints a warning that the value is visible in process listings and recommends the interactive prompt
- **Legacy XOR credential decryption now logged** — transparent XOR→AES-256-GCM migration now emits `tracing::warn!` so administrators can track remaining legacy credentials

### Fixed
- **Highlight rules not applied without per-connection rules** — built-in defaults (ERROR, WARNING, CRITICAL, FATAL) and global highlight rules were skipped when a connection had no per-connection rules; removed the `is_empty()` guard so highlights always apply ([#66](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/66))
- **CLI `add --protocol zerotrust` silently created SSH connection** — now returns an error instead of logging and falling back to SSH
- **Config file corruption on crash** — sync `save_toml_file` now uses atomic temp-file + rename pattern matching the async version
- **Blocking DNS in async `check_port_async`** — replaced `to_socket_addrs()` with `tokio::net::lookup_host()` to avoid blocking the tokio worker thread

### Improved
- **Sidebar shows full connection name on hover** — tooltip displays full name and host for truncated entries; removed `max_width_chars` limit so labels use all available sidebar space
- **Log sanitization performance** — `sanitize_output()` regex patterns compiled once via `LazyLock` instead of on every call; `SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` deduplicated from 29 to 16 lowercase-only entries
- **CLI `parse_protocol` consolidated** — three duplicate implementations in `add.rs`, `template.rs`, `smart_folder.rs` replaced with shared `parse_protocol_type()` + `default_port_for_protocol()` in `util.rs`
- **`ProtocolResult<T>` deduplication** — removed duplicate type alias from `protocol/mod.rs`, now re-exported from `error.rs`
- **OpenTelemetry tracing variant marked deprecated** — `TracingOutput::OpenTelemetry` now has `#[deprecated]` attribute until implementation is complete
- **Dead code cleanup** — removed unused `AppStateError`, `VncLauncher`, `FieldValidator`/`FormValidator` framework, `initialize_secret_backends()`, `create_async_resolver()`

- Updated: `rustls-webpki` 0.103.9→0.103.10, `zune-jpeg` 0.5.13→0.5.14
## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **MOSH connections not working** — `start_connection()` dispatch was missing the `"mosh"` arm; MOSH connections silently failed. Added `start_mosh_connection()` with port check, binary detection, and CLI feedback
- **Auto-recording not triggered** — `session_recording_enabled` toggle in connection dialog had no effect; wired auto-recording into SSH, Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes, and MOSH connection handlers using `connect_contents_changed` callback
- **Highlight rules not applied** — per-connection `highlight_rules` were saved but never passed to `TerminalNotebook`; wired `set_highlight_rules()` call into all protocol handlers after terminal tab creation
- **`script` command visible on recording start** — replaced synchronous `feed()` erase with 100ms delayed erase via `glib::timeout_add_local_once` so PTY echo arrives before the clear sequence; added leading space for `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace`
- **Double exit and UI freeze on recording stop** — replaced `exit\n` with `\x04` (Ctrl+D/EOF) to terminate `script` sub-shell without visible echo; moved SCP file retrieval and remote cleanup to background thread via `spawn_blocking_with_callback`
- **Lost commands in recording playback** — added `strip_script_command_echo()` that removes the echoed `script -q -f --log-out …` line from recording data with timing entry adjustment, analogous to existing `strip_script_header()`
- **.rdp files not opening on double-click** — created `application/x-rdp` MIME type XML definition (`io.github.totoshko88.RustConn-rdp.xml`); installed in all packaging formats: Flatpak, Flathub, OBS RPM/DEB, native install script ([#64](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/64))
- **Sidebar stretching with long connection names** — added `ellipsize(End)` and `max_width_chars(35)` to sidebar connection label ([#64](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/64))
- **picocom not detected in Flatpak** — `picocom --help` returns exit code 1 on v3.x causing detection failure; added `which_binary()` fallback that confirms binary existence without running it ([#62](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/62))
- **RDP "indefinite connection" with no feedback** — improved error message when FreeRDP is not installed: now shows "Install FreeRDP 3.x (xfreerdp3 or wlfreerdp3)" instead of raw error ([#61](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/61))
- **IronRDP debug log spam** — filtered `ironrdp`, `ironrdp_session`, `ironrdp_tokio` crates to `warn` level in tracing subscriber; suppresses noisy `Non-32 bpp compressed RLE_BITMAP_STREAM` messages

### Improved
- **CSV import auto-detects delimiter** — `.tsv` files use tab; for `.csv` files, heuristic compares comma/semicolon/tab counts in the first line and picks the most frequent separator
- **Script credentials test feedback** — "Test Script" button now runs the configured command with 30s timeout, shows success with masked output preview or failure with stderr and exit code
- **Config sync documentation** — added "Configuration Sync Between Machines" section to User Guide with Git, Syncthing/rsync, CLI export/import, and built-in Backup/Restore instructions

- New: `shell-words` 1.x added to `rustconn` crate (script credential test button)
- Updated: `aws-lc-rs` 1.16.1→1.16.2, `aws-lc-sys` 0.38.0→0.39.0, `itoa` 1.0.17→1.0.18, `tar` 0.4.44→0.4.45
## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-19

### Note
Thank you to **Todor Todorov** for the support and for pointing out that the donation link was broken. The donation service has been changed and is now working. Today marks 8 months of active development on RustConn. If you'd like to support the project financially, I'd be very grateful: [https://donatello.to/totoshko88](https://donatello.to/totoshko88)

### Added
- **MOSH protocol** — new protocol type with predict mode (Adaptive/Always/Never), SSH port, UDP port range, server binary path, and custom arguments; `MoshProtocol` handler with `build_command()`, `detect_mosh()` in detection module; GUI tab in connection dialog; CLI support
- **CSV import/export** — RFC 4180 compliant CSV parsing and generation; auto column mapping from headers (`name`, `host`, `port`, `protocol`, `username`, `group`, `tags`, `description`); configurable delimiter (comma, semicolon, tab); GUI import dialog with column mapping preview; CLI `import --format csv` and `export --format csv` with `--delimiter` and `--fields` options
- **Session recording** — scriptreplay-compatible format (data + timing files); per-connection toggle in Advanced tab; `●REC` indicator in tab title; sanitization of sensitive output; recordings saved to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rustconn/recordings/`
- **Text highlighting rules** — regex-based pattern matching with foreground/background colors; per-connection and global rules; built-in defaults for ERROR (red), WARNING (yellow), CRITICAL/FATAL (red background); rules editor in Settings and Connection Dialog; VTE integration
- **Ad-hoc broadcast** — send keystrokes to multiple terminals simultaneously; toolbar toggle button with keyboard shortcut; per-terminal checkboxes for selection; separate from existing cluster broadcast
- **Smart Folders** — dynamic connection grouping with filter criteria: protocol type, tags (AND logic), host glob pattern (`*.prod.example.com`), parent group; sidebar section with read-only connection list; create/edit/delete dialogs; CLI `smart-folders list/show/create/delete` subcommands
- **Script credentials** — `PasswordSource::Script` variant for dynamic credential resolution; shell command parsed via `shell-words`; 30-second timeout via `tokio::time::timeout`; stdout trimmed to `SecretString`; GUI entry with Test button in Auth tab
- **Per-connection terminal theming** — color overrides (background, foreground, cursor) per connection in `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` format; 3 `ColorDialogButton` widgets in Advanced tab; Reset button; VTE `set_color_background/foreground/cursor` integration
- **15 new language translations** — all new UI strings for 8 features translated across uk, de, fr, es, it, pl, cs, sk, da, sv, nl, pt, be, kk, uz

- New: `csv` 1.x (RFC 4180 parsing), `glob` 0.3 (Smart Folder host matching), `shell-words` 1.x (script credential argument splitting)
### Fixed
- Flatpak SSH key paths become stale after rebuild — keys copied to stable `~/.var/app/<app-id>/.ssh/` with fallback resolution ([#62](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/62))
- SFTP `ssh-add` uses stale portal key path — resolved via `resolve_key_path()` before use
- SFTP mc opens even when `ssh-add` fails — now aborts with toast error and "failed" status
- `script` command format updated to `--log-out`/`--log-timing` for modern util-linux
- Remote SSH recording used local paths — now extracts SSH config for remote `script` execution
- Recording playback showed `Script started on …` header — stripped with timing adjustment
- `script` invocation visible in terminal — erased via ANSI escape after `feed_child`
- SCP host key verification prompts in `stop_recording()` — added `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`
- RDP sidebar status not clearing after disconnect — `decrement_session_count` called with correct flag
- `PlaybackToolbar` GtkSearchEntry finalization warning — `Drop` unparents popover
- `cargo/config` deprecation warning in Flatpak build — renamed to `config.toml`
- Flatpak local manifest runtime updated from GNOME 50beta to GNOME 50
- Dependencies: euclid 0.22.14, toml 1.0.7, zerocopy 0.8.47, zip 8.3

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-16

> **Note:** Flatpak release will follow after March 18, 2026, when GNOME 50 runtime is published on Flathub.

### Added
- **RDP file import in GUI** — `.rdp` files can now be imported via the Import dialog (Ctrl+I); previously only available through file association and CLI
- **CLI import: 4 new formats** — `rustconn-cli import` now supports `--format rdp`, `rdm`, `virt-viewer`, and `libvirt` in addition to the existing 7 formats
- **Split view for Telnet, Serial, Kubernetes** — split view now works with all VTE terminal-based protocols, not just SSH/SFTP/Local Shell
- **Statistics: Most Used & Protocol Distribution** — statistics dialog now shows top-3 most used connections and protocol usage breakdown with progress bars
- **5 new customizable keybindings** — Toggle Sidebar (F9), Connection History (Ctrl+H), Statistics (Ctrl+Shift+I), Password Generator (Ctrl+G), Wake On LAN (Ctrl+Shift+L); total now 31 actions
- **Sidebar keyboard shortcuts** — F2 renames selected connection/group, Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V copies/pastes connections, Ctrl+M moves to group; all scoped to sidebar focus so they don't intercept VTE terminal or embedded viewer input
- **Dynamic inventory sync** — new `rustconn-cli sync` command synchronizes connections from external JSON/YAML inventory files; matches by source tag + name + host; supports `--remove-stale` to clean absent connections and `--dry-run` for preview ([#56](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/56))
- **RDP file association** — double-clicking an `.rdp` file opens RustConn and connects automatically; supports address, credentials, gateway, resolution, audio, and clipboard fields ([#54](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/54))
- **FreeRDP bundled in Flatpak** — FreeRDP 3.24.0 SDL3 client built into the Flatpak; external RDP works out of the box on Wayland without `DISPLAY`
- **`sdl-freerdp3` detection** — FreeRDP detection now includes SDL3 variants (`sdl-freerdp3`, `sdl-freerdp`); Wayland priority: `wlfreerdp3` > `wlfreerdp` > `sdl-freerdp3` > `sdl-freerdp` > `xfreerdp3`

### Improved
- **i18n: hardcoded English strings wrapped** — ~40 user-visible strings across sidebar, embedded viewers (RDP, VNC, SPICE), session status overlays, and toolbar buttons now use `i18n()` for translation
- **i18n: accessible labels translatable** — ~25 `update_property` accessible labels in sidebar, window UI, embedded toolbar, and viewer controls wrapped with `i18n()`
- **i18n: protocol display names** — wrapped `display_name()` call sites with `i18n()` and added translations for 15 strings across all 15 languages
- **User-friendly VNC error messages** — raw error variants in VNC session toasts replaced with actionable messages ("Authentication failed. Check your credentials.", "Connection error")
- **VTE context menu moved off terminal widget** — `GestureClick` controller for the right-click context menu moved from the VTE terminal to its container widget; prevents interference with VTE's internal mouse event processing in ncurses/slang applications
- **VTE terminal no longer wrapped in ScrolledWindow** — redundant `ScrolledWindow` wrappers removed since VTE implements `GtkScrollable` natively
- **Monitoring module property tests** — 12 new tests covering `MonitoringSettings`, `MonitoringConfig`, `MetricsParser`, and `MetricsComputer`
- **Stale X11 comment removed** — `embedded.rs` comment referencing `GtkSocket` / X11 embedding updated to reflect native protocol clients

### Fixed
- **Secret backend default mismatch** — `SecretBackendType` default changed from `KeePassXc` to `LibSecret` to match User Guide and provide a universal out-of-the-box experience on all Linux desktops

#### Flatpak sandbox
- **waypipe not detected** — C-only build installs as `waypipe-c`, not `waypipe`; added `post-install` symlink in Flatpak manifest; `detect_waypipe()` now also tries `waypipe-c` as fallback; `which_binary()` checks `/app/bin/` directly in sandbox
- **SFTP file manager ignores SSH key** — external file managers (Dolphin, Nautilus) launched via `xdg-open` run outside the sandbox and cannot access the sandbox's SSH agent; `sftp_use_mc` now defaults to `true` in Flatpak so Midnight Commander (bundled) is used instead
- **ssh-agent socket in read-only `~/.ssh`** — `ensure_ssh_agent()` now uses `-a $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rustconn-ssh-agent.sock` inside Flatpak so the agent socket is created in a writable directory
- **KeePassXC not detected** — `keepassxc-cli` on the host system is now detected and executed via `flatpak-spawn --host`; all KDBX operations work transparently inside the sandbox; "Open Password Manager" button launches KeePassXC on the host
- **SSH jump host broken** — replaced `-J` with `-o ProxyCommand=ssh -W %h:%p ...` that passes `StrictHostKeyChecking`, `UserKnownHostsFile`, and identity file to the jump host process
- **mc wrapper not found** — stripped host-exported `mc()` bash function via `--unset-env=BASH_FUNC_mc%%`; installed sandbox wrapper for correct directory-change-on-exit
- **ZeroTrust and Kubernetes connections broken** — CLI tools (`aws`, `gcloud`, `az`, `kubectl`) now detected and executed via `flatpak-spawn --host`; cloud CLI config dirs mounted into sandbox so credentials are shared between sandbox and host
- **mc mouse clicks produce artifacts** — the `xterm-256color` terminfo entry's `XM` extended capability tells ncurses/slang to negotiate SGR mouse mode (1006) with VTE 0.80; mc cannot parse SGR-encoded mouse events, causing raw escape fragments like `7;6M7;6m` on every click; fix: compiled a custom `rustconn-256color` terminfo entry (identical to `xterm-256color` but without `XM`); VTE child processes in Flatpak use `TERM=rustconn-256color` to prevent the negotiation; additionally switched mc build from ncurses to slang and mc SFTP uses `-g` (`--oldmouse`) flag as defense-in-depth

#### Terminal / mc
- **mc SFTP: initial window not fullscreen** — mc read terminal dimensions before VTE widget received its GTK size allocation; added 150ms delay before spawning mc
- **Split view: text selection broken** — `GestureClick` handler no longer claims clicks on `VteTerminal` widgets

#### RDP
- **Crash on RDP connect (RefCell already borrowed)** — the IronRDP event polling loop held an immutable `client_ref.borrow()` while `handle_ironrdp_error` attempted `client_ref.borrow_mut().take()`, causing a double-borrow panic; error handling is now deferred until after the borrow is dropped ([#57](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/57))
- **Crash on RDP connect (ironrdp-tokio panic)** — upstream bug in `ironrdp-tokio 0.8.0` causes `copy_from_slice` panic on 64-bit systems during KDC TCP response parsing; `connect_finalize` is now wrapped in `catch_unwind` so the panic is converted to an error and the GUI falls back to FreeRDP instead of crashing
- **RDP gateway ignored in embedded mode** — IronRDP doesn't support RD Gateway; now falls back to external xfreerdp with a toast ([#53](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/53))
- **External RDP sidebar icon stays green after tab close** — fixed session ID / connection ID mismatch in `add_embedded_session_tab`; external xfreerdp process is now killed on tab close

#### SSH
- **Custom options format unclear** — subtitle now reads "Key=Value, comma-separated" with an example placeholder so users don't have to guess the format ([#58](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/58))
- **`UserKnownHostsFile` defaults to Flatpak path on native build** — `is_flatpak()` now requires `FLATPAK_ID` to match our app ID, preventing false positives when the env var leaks from another Flatpak process ([#59](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/59))

#### Terminal
- **Ctrl+W closes tab instead of deleting word** — changed close-tab shortcut from Ctrl+W to Ctrl+Shift+W (GNOME standard); Ctrl+W now passes through to the shell for backward-kill-word; close-pane moved to Ctrl+Shift+X ([#60](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/60))

#### UI / Clippy
- **Default window size too small on first start** — minimum size increased to 800×500; welcome screen adapts to narrow windows ([#55](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/55))
- **CSS parser warning: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)`** — GTK4 CSS parser requires explicit value; changed to `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
- **Clippy: `RdpCommand::Connect` large enum variant** — boxed `RdpConfig` payload to reduce enum size from 240 to 16 bytes
- **Clippy: case-sensitive `.rdp` extension check** — now uses `Path::extension()` with `eq_ignore_ascii_case`
- **Clippy: collapsible `if` and `if-not-else`** — cleaned up nested conditionals in protocols, window, and main modules

### Changed
- **GTK4/libadwaita/VTE crate upgrade** — gtk4 0.10→0.11, libadwaita 0.8→0.9, vte4 0.9→0.10; unlocks GNOME 48–50 APIs
- **MSRV bumped to 1.92** — required by updated GTK-rs bindings
- **Flatpak runtime bumped to GNOME 50** — all three manifests now use `org.gnome.Platform` 50 with VTE 0.80
- **AdwSpinner migration** — replaces `gtk::Spinner` in export dialog; cfg-gated `adw-1-6`
- **AdwShortcutsDialog migration** — replaces deprecated `gtk::ShortcutsWindow`; cfg-gated `adw-1-8`
- **AdwSwitchRow migration** — replaces manual `ActionRow` + `Switch` in monitoring, logging, and secrets settings tabs
- **AdwWrapBox for protocol filters** — sidebar filters wrap on narrow sidebars; cfg-gated `adw-1-7` with `GtkBox` fallback
- **Welcome screen refreshed** — updated feature highlights, replaced performance internals with Quick Access tips, added Command Palette / Import / Settings shortcuts
- **CSS `prefers-reduced-motion`** — transitions disabled when reduced motion is requested
- **Tiered distro feature flags** — `adw-1-8` for Tumbleweed/Fedora 43+, `adw-1-6` for Leap 16.0/Fedora 42, baseline for older distros
- **Codebase cleanup** — removed 25+ unused CSS classes, consolidated `futures-util` into `futures`, fixed metainfo.xml duplicates, added k8s keywords, removed dead code

- clap 4.5.60→4.6.0, gtk4 0.11.0→0.11.1, gdk4 0.11.0→0.11.1, gsk4 0.11.0→0.11.1, glib 0.22.2→0.22.3, openssl 0.10.75→0.10.76, tracing-subscriber 0.3.22→0.3.23
- Transitive: anstream 0.6.21→1.0.0, anstyle 1.0.13→1.0.14, anstyle-parse 0.2.7→1.0.0, cc 1.2.56→1.2.57, clap_complete 4.5.66→4.6.0, clap_mangen 0.2.31→0.2.33, colorchoice 1.0.4→1.0.5, glib-sys 0.22.0→0.22.3, once_cell 1.21.3→1.21.4, roff 0.2.2→1.1.0, tinyvec 1.10.0→1.11.0, uds_windows 1.2.0→1.2.1
## [0.9.15] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Hide local cursor option for embedded viewers** — new "Show Local Cursor" checkbox in RDP, VNC, and SPICE connection dialogs (Features section) allows hiding the local OS cursor over embedded viewers to eliminate the "double cursor" effect; enabled by default for backward compatibility ([#51](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/51))

### Fixed
- **VNC session ignores Display Mode setting** — the "Display Mode" dropdown (Embedded/External/Fullscreen) in the Advanced tab was saved correctly but had no effect on VNC sessions; now Fullscreen maximizes the main window (same as RDP), and External forces the external VNC viewer (TigerVNC/vncviewer) instead of the embedded vnc-rs client ([#50](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/50))
- **SSH port forwarding via UI broken** — `window/protocols.rs` built SSH args manually, skipping `port_forwards`, X11 forwarding (`-X`), compression (`-C`), and `ControlPersist=10m` from `SshConfig`; refactored to delegate to `SshConfig::build_command_args()` which has the complete logic ([#49](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/49))
- **SSH custom options `-o` prefix not stripped** — `parse_custom_options()` expected `Key=Value` format but users pasted `-o Key=Value` from CLI; now silently strips the `-o` prefix ([#49](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/49))
- **SSH custom options placeholder misleading** — dialog showed `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` format but parser expected comma-separated `Key=Value`; updated placeholder and subtitle to clarify correct format ([#49](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/49))

## [0.9.14] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **SSH connection fails in Flatpak on KDE** — host `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable (e.g. `ksshaskpass`) was inherited by the VTE child process but not available inside the sandbox, causing `Permission denied` before the password prompt appeared; now stripped from the terminal environment since RustConn uses native VTE password injection ([#48](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/48))
- **Header bar buttons clipped when sidebar + monitoring enabled** — monitoring bar's system info label could request more width than available in the content area, causing overflow that pushed header bar buttons out of bounds; fixed by adding `ellipsize` to variable-length labels and `overflow: hidden` on the monitoring bar container ([#47](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/47))

- tokio 1.49→1.50, uuid 1.21→1.22, regex 1.11→1.12, proptest 1.9→1.10, tempfile 3.23→3.26, zip 8.1→8.2, criterion 0.8.1→0.8.2, rpassword 7.3→7.4
- Transitive: hybrid-array 0.4.7→0.4.8, image 0.25.9→0.25.10, libc 0.2.182→0.2.183, libz-sys 1.1.24→1.1.25, moxcms 0.7.11→0.8.1, quinn-proto 0.11.13→0.11.14, schannel 0.1.28→0.1.29, zerocopy 0.8.40→0.8.42
## [0.9.13] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **RDP handshake timeout on loaded servers** — Phase 3 (TLS upgrade + NLA + connect_finalize) now wrapped in `tokio::time::timeout` with `timeout_secs × 2` (minimum 60s); previously only TCP connect had a timeout, causing indefinite hangs when the remote server was under heavy load
- **ARM64 binary download mismatch** — `download_url_for_arch()` on aarch64 no longer falls back to x86_64 URL when no ARM64 binary exists; `get_available_components()` now filters out components unavailable for the current architecture (affects TigerVNC Viewer and Bitwarden CLI)

### Added
- **RDP Quick Actions menu** — new dropdown button on the embedded RDP toolbar with 6 Windows admin shortcuts: Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), Settings (Win+I), PowerShell, CMD, Event Viewer, Services; actions send scancode sequences via `SendKeySequence` command with 30ms inter-key delay

## [0.9.12] - 2026-03-08

### Security
- **Removed sshpass dependency** — interactive SSH sessions now use native VTE password injection via `feed_child()`; monitoring SSH uses `SSH_ASKPASS` mechanism with temporary script instead of `SSHPASS` environment variable (no longer visible in `/proc/PID/environ`)
- **Bitwarden master password zeroized on drop** — `unlock_vault()` now wraps the temporary plain-text password copy in `Zeroizing<String>` so heap memory is scrubbed when the blocking task completes
- **SSH monitoring askpass script cleaned up on drop** — temporary `SSH_ASKPASS` helper script is now deleted automatically when the monitoring session ends (RAII wrapper with `Drop` impl)

### Improved
- **Reduced state.rs complexity** — extracted vault operations (~979 lines) into `vault_ops.rs`, trimming `state.rs` from 3143 to 2167 lines
- **Reduced window/mod.rs complexity** — extracted `setup_edit_actions` (637 lines), `setup_terminal_actions` (298 lines), and `setup_split_view_actions` (746 lines) into separate modules, trimming `window/mod.rs` from 5316 to 3648 lines

### Changed
- **SPICE embedded client enabled by default** — `spice-embedded` feature flag now included in default features for both `rustconn-core` and `rustconn` crates; native SPICE client (via `spice-client` crate) is now the primary connection method with `remote-viewer` as fallback

### Removed
- **sshpass** — removed from all packaging manifests (Flatpak, Flathub, Debian, OBS RPM, Snap); no longer a runtime dependency

## [0.9.11] - 2026-03-07

### Security
- **Bitwarden session key now uses SecretString** — session key was stored as plain `String` in memory without zeroization; migrated to `SecretString` with `expose_secret()` only at CLI invocation point
- **Config files written with 0600 permissions** — connection data (hostnames, usernames, port forwards) was world-readable on multi-user systems; config directory now created with 0700
- **SSH monitoring host key verification** — removed unconditional `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`; now uses `accept-new` by default (accepts first-seen keys, rejects changed keys)
- **Session log sanitization active by default** — built-in sensitive patterns (password prompts, API keys, tokens) were defined but never wired into the sanitizer; now active in `SanitizeConfig::default()`
- **Flatpak device permissions documented** — `--device=all` retained in Flatpak manifests with justification comment (serial ports for picocom require it; Flatpak has no granular `--device=serial` option)
- **Monitoring password uses SecretString** — `ssh_exec_factory` password parameter migrated from plain `String` to `SecretString` with zeroization; `expose_secret()` used only at `SSHPASS` env var injection point
- **RDP TLS certificate policy documented** — `establish_connection` now documents that IronRDP does not validate server certificates (standard for RDP self-signed certs); added `tracing::warn!` on each connection

### Fixed
- **Encrypted document format ambiguity** — legacy salt byte could be misinterpreted as encryption strength byte (~1.2% chance); introduced V2 magic header `RCDB_EN2` for unambiguous format detection

### Added
- **Monitoring: remote host private IP** — monitoring bar now shows the primary private IP address in the system info section; hovering shows hostname, all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses grouped separately
- **Monitoring: live uptime counter** — uptime in the system info tooltip now updates on every metrics polling tick instead of remaining static until the next full system info refresh
- **Monitoring: stopped indication** — when the metrics collector stops (3 consecutive failures), the monitoring bar dims to 50% opacity, shows a warning icon, and the tooltip displays "⚠ Monitoring stopped"
- **Monitoring: all mount points** — disk section now shows root filesystem in the level bar and all mounted real filesystems in the tooltip (mount point, used/total, percentage); virtual filesystems (tmpfs, devtmpfs, squashfs, overlay) and snap loop mounts are filtered out

### Removed
- **Dead `read_import_file_async`** — unused async import helper removed from `rustconn-core/src/import/traits.rs`

## [0.9.10] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Connection dialog Basic tab clipped** — removed redundant outer `ScrolledWindow` wrapping the `ViewStack`; each tab already provides its own scroller, so the nested scroll stole height allocation and clipped the Basic tab content
- **Dialog minimum sizes missing** — added `set_size_request` to Import, Export, and Shortcuts dialogs to prevent UI breakage on small screens
- **Remmina import fails in Flatpak** — importer now also checks the host path `~/.local/share/remmina/` when running inside Flatpak sandbox ([#44](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/44))

### Improved
- **Connection dialog default height** — increased from 500→670px so the Basic tab fields (including Description) are fully visible without scrolling on typical displays

- serde_yaml_ng 0.9→0.10, cfg-expr 0.20.6→0.20.7, inotify 0.11.0→0.11.1, socket2 0.6.2→0.6.3, toml 1.0.4→1.0.6
- CLI downloads: Teleport 18.7.1→18.7.2
## [0.9.9] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **sshpass not installed in Flatpak** — SSH password-authenticated connections broken in Flatpak 0.9.8 ([#42](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/42))
- **Jump host connections fail port check** — pre-connect TCP probe always timed out for destinations reachable only through a jump host; now skipped when `jump_host_id` or `proxy_jump` is configured ([#41](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/41))
- **Jump host dropdown hard to use** — added host address to dropdown labels (`Name (host)`) and enabled search filtering for quick lookup
- **Jump host monitoring fails** — monitoring SSH commands now include `-J` jump host chain so metrics collection works through bastion hosts ([#41](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/41))
- **Jump host false positive connection status** — SSH status detection now checks terminal text for failure patterns (`Connection timed out`, `Connection refused`, etc.) before marking jump host connections as established ([#41](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/41))

- Bitwarden CLI 2026.1.0→2026.2.0, uuid 1.21.0→1.22.0, winnow 0.7.14→0.7.15
## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-05

### Security
- **RDP password no longer exposed on command line** — FreeRDP fallback now uses `/from-stdin` instead of `/p:{password}` argument

### Fixed
- **SSH connection status not turning green** — VTE cursor position axes were swapped; status detection callbacks were skipped when async port check is enabled
- **Automation cursor tracking** — expect-script automation read wrong cursor axis from VTE
- **RDP keyboard input duplication** — deduplicated key press/release handlers via shared `send_ironrdp_key()`
- **Username placeholder on empty `$USER`** — falls back to `$LOGNAME`, then generic placeholder

### Added

**Connection dialog — protocol improvements:**
- **SSH** — password source validation on save, key source "Default" explanation, custom options placeholder, port forwarding duplicate detection
- **RDP** — gateway port/username fields, disable NLA checkbox, clipboard sharing toggle, dynamic resolution info
- **VNC** — encoding dropdown (Auto/Tight/ZRLE/Hextile/Raw/CopyRect), performance mode auto-sync, auth info
- **SPICE** — proxy field for Proxmox VE, CA certificate validation, TLS/skip-verification sensitivity logic
- **Serial** — device auto-detection (`/dev/ttyUSB*`, `/dev/ttyACM*`, `/dev/ttyS*`), dialout group warning
- **Kubernetes** — pod name validation, busybox mode sensitivity
- **Telnet** — plaintext transmission security warning
- **Zero Trust** — CLI availability check, OCI Bastion SSH key/TTL fields, generic command placeholder docs

**Connection dialog — general:**
- Domain field hidden for non-RDP protocols
- MAC address format validation for Wake-on-LAN
- Granular per-connection logging options (activity, input, output, timestamps)
- Password source ↔ SSH auth method auto-sync

**Other:**
- **SFTP mc in split view** — mc-based SFTP sessions now support horizontal/vertical split like SSH
- **Context menu "New Connection"** — opens dialog with the connection's group pre-selected

### Improved
- **Connection dialog decomposition** — extracted 4 tab modules from monolithic `dialog.rs` (~7500→~1500 lines)
- **Embedded RDP decomposition** — extracted 5 modules from monolithic `mod.rs` (~2900→~500 lines)
- **Code quality** — structured tracing fields, i18n coverage, deduplication of clipboard/callback/resize patterns, module-level lint allows removed

- binrw 0.15.0→0.15.1, proc-macro-crate 3.4.0→3.5.0, toml 1.0.3→1.0.4, toml_edit 0.23.10→0.25.4, uds_windows 1.1.0→1.2.0
## [0.9.7] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Connection group not saved** — connection dialog used a separate `Rc` for `groups_data` in the save closure vs the struct field, so `set_groups()` updated the struct but the save handler always read the initial `[(None, "(Root)")]`; connections now correctly land in the selected subgroup on both create and edit ([#40](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/40))
- **Secret variable values lost after settings reopen** — secret variables had their values cleared before persisting to disk (stored in vault), but were never restored from vault when reopening the Variables dialog or substituting `${VAR}` in connections; added `resolve_global_variables()` that loads secret values from the configured vault backend
- **Crash on session reconnect** — `close_tab` held an immutable borrow on `sessions` while `tab_view.close_page()` synchronously fired the `close-page` signal handler which needed a mutable borrow, causing a `BorrowMutError` panic; separated the borrow from the close call ([#39](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/39))

### Changed
- **Bitwarden credential lookup speed** — removed per-retrieve `bw sync` (network round-trip) and added a 120-second verification cache for `bw status` checks; vault syncs once on unlock instead of on every credential lookup, making reconnect and batch operations significantly faster

- tokio 1.49→1.50, aws-lc-rs 1.16.0→1.16.1, aws-lc-sys 0.37.1→0.38.0, getrandom 0.4.1→0.4.2, ipnet 2.11→2.12, quote 1.0.44→1.0.45, tokio-macros 2.6.0→2.6.1, zip 8.1→8.2
## [0.9.6] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Bitwarden Flatpak session key** — `build_command` now falls back to the global in-process session store when the instance-level key is absent, so `SecretManager.is_available()` correctly sees an unlocked vault after `auto_unlock` ([#28](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/28))
- **Bitwarden Settings auto-unlock path** — secrets tab auto-unlock now uses `get_bw_cmd()` (globally resolved path) instead of the local `Rc<RefCell>` which may still hold the bare `"bw"` before detection completes
- **Connection dialog credential download** — lookup key now uses `generate_store_key()` (UUID-based) instead of `"{name} ({protocol})"` format, matching the key used by Bitwarden/1Password/Passbolt store operations
- **Vault credential resolve for non-KeePass backends** — `resolve_credentials_blocking` now has a direct `PasswordSource::Vault` block that calls `dispatch_vault_op` with `auto_unlock` for Bitwarden and other backends, instead of falling through to `CredentialResolver` which created a fresh `BitwardenBackend` without session
- **Inherit condition for non-KeePass backends** — group password inheritance no longer blocked when `kdbx_enabled=true` but preferred backend is Bitwarden/1Password/Passbolt/Pass; condition changed from `!kdbx_enabled` to `!matches!(preferred_backend, KeePassXc | KdbxFile)`
- **Group password load from any backend** — group edit dialog password load button now dispatches to the configured default secret backend via `select_backend_for_load` + `dispatch_vault_op`, instead of hardcoded KeePass/Keyring-only branches
- **SSH known_hosts not persisting in Flatpak** — SSH connections now use `-o UserKnownHostsFile=~/.var/app/<app-id>/.ssh/known_hosts` in Flatpak sandbox where `~/.ssh` is mounted read-only; directory is auto-created; applies to interactive SSH, sshpass, Quick Connect, and monitoring; respects user-set `UserKnownHostsFile` in custom options
- **Duplicate reconnect banner** — `TerminalNotebook` now tracks shown reconnect banners per session to prevent duplicates on repeated child-exit signals
- **SSH dialog key fields for Keyboard Interactive** — auth method visibility now correctly hides key path/passphrase fields for Keyboard Interactive (index 2), same as Password (index 0)

### Changed
- **Dependency updates** — moka 0.12.13→0.12.14, pxfm 0.1.27→0.1.28, zlib-rs 0.6.2→0.6.3; kubectl pinned 1.35.1→1.35.2

## [0.9.5] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **SSH/Telnet pre-connect port check** — fail fast with retry toast instead of hanging in "Connecting" state
- **Vault credential lifecycle** — orphaned credentials cleaned on trash empty; paste duplicates credentials; group rename/move migrates KeePass entries
- **Consistent credential keys** — unified `generate_store_key()` across all backends; fixed silent lookup failures from key format mismatch
- **SecretManager cache TTL** — entries expire after 5 minutes, preventing stale credentials
- **Inherit cycle protection** — `HashSet<Uuid>` visited guard prevents infinite loops in group hierarchy
- **Group change in connection dialog** — selecting a different group now correctly persists on save
- **Monitoring race condition** — waits for SSH handshake before opening monitoring channel

### Security
- **SecretString migration** — RDP/SPICE event credentials, GUI password structs, CLI input, and `Variable` (zeroize on Drop) all use `SecretString`

### Changed
- **Backend dispatch consolidation** — `VaultOp` enum + `dispatch_vault_op()` replaces ~200 lines of duplicated match blocks
- **Mutex lock safety** — ~50 `unwrap()` on `Mutex::lock()` replaced with `lock_or_log()` helper
- **Error logging** — `let _ =` on persistence ops replaced with `tracing::warn!`; remaining `eprintln!` migrated
- **CSS extraction** — 595-line inline CSS moved to `rustconn/assets/style.css`
- **i18n consistency** — hardcoded English strings wrapped with `i18n()` / `i18n_f()`
- **CI** — `--all-features` added to test jobs for feature-gated code coverage

### Removed
- Dead code: `StateAccessError`, unused state accessors, legacy dialog tabs, ~30 unused sidebar methods

- js-sys 0.3.90→0.3.91, pin-project-lite 0.2.16→0.2.17, wasm-bindgen 0.2.113→0.2.114, web-sys 0.3.90→0.3.91
## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Session Reconnect** — disconnected VTE tabs show a "Reconnect" banner to re-launch in one click
- **Recursive Group Delete** — three-option dialog: keep children, cascade delete, or cancel
- **Connection History** — search/filter by name/host/protocol; per-entry delete
- **Cluster from sidebar** — "Create Cluster" pre-selects checked connections
- **Shortcut conflict detection** — warning when a keybinding is already assigned
- **Settings Backup/Restore** — export/import all config as ZIP via Settings → Interface
- **Libvirt / GNOME Boxes import** — VNC, SPICE, RDP from domain XML; auto-scans qemu dirs ([#38](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/38))
- **Automation templates** — 5 built-in expect rule presets (Sudo, SSH Host Key, Login, etc.)
- **TemplateManager** — centralized template CRUD with search, protocol filtering, import/export
- **Snippet shell safety** — warns about dangerous metacharacters in variable values before `--execute`

### Fixed
- **Password inheritance** — `PasswordSource::Variable` now resolved in group hierarchy ([#37](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/37))
- **New connection in wrong group** — context menu now pre-selects the target group ([#37](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/37))
- **Toast system** — severity icons, "Retry" on port-check failures, `AlertDialog` fallback, i18n
- **VTE spawn failure** — missing command shows "Command not found" banner + error toast instead of silent empty terminal
- **Cluster broadcast** — keyboard input now actually broadcasts to all cluster terminals; session lifecycle wired; disconnect-all button; full i18n
- **Pango markup** — escaped ampersand in "Backup & Restore" settings title
- **Adwaita dark theme warning** — suppressed on KDE/XFCE desktops

### Improved
- **User Guide** — major rewrite: Zero Trust, Security, FAQ, Migration Guide, expanded all sections
- **Automation engine** — one-shot rules, per-rule timeout, regex validation, template picker, pre-connect/post-disconnect tasks, key sequences on connect
- **Template management** — CLI and GUI migrated to `TemplateManager`; GUI keeps document integration

- **Updated**: js-sys 0.3.90→0.3.91, pin-project-lite 0.2.16→0.2.17, wasm-bindgen 0.2.113→0.2.114, web-sys 0.3.90→0.3.91
## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Waypipe Support** — Wayland application forwarding for SSH connections via `waypipe`; auto-detected on Wayland sessions when `waypipe` binary is available on PATH; per-connection toggle in SSH Session options; graceful fallback to direct SSH when unavailable ([#36](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/36))
- **IronRDP Clipboard Integration** — Bidirectional clipboard sync between local desktop and remote RDP session via cliprdr channel; server→client text is auto-synced to local GTK clipboard; local clipboard changes are automatically announced to the server; Copy/Paste buttons remain as manual fallback; feedback loop prevention via suppression flag

### Fixed
- **Missing icons on KDE and non-GNOME desktops** — Replaced all non-standard icon names (`emblem-ok-symbolic`, `emblem-system-symbolic`, `call-start-symbolic`, `modem-symbolic`, `application-x-executable-symbolic`, etc.) with freedesktop-standard equivalents; replaced icons missing from Adwaita (`emblem-default-symbolic`, `emblem-synchronizing-symbolic`, `utilities-system-monitor-symbolic`, `view-sidebar-start-symbolic`, `tag-symbolic`) with available alternatives; forced Adwaita icon theme via `GtkSettings` for consistent icon availability on all desktops; unified protocol icons via single source of truth in `icons.rs`, eliminating hardcoded duplicates across sidebar, tabs, dialogs, templates, and cluster views ([#35](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/35))
- **Serial connection creation failed** — Serial and Kubernetes connections no longer require host/port validation (they use device path / pod name instead); previously "Host cannot be empty" error blocked saving these connections
- **Serial/Kubernetes missing client toast** — Shows user-friendly toast when picocom (Serial) or kubectl (Kubernetes) is not installed, and when Kubernetes pod/container configuration is incomplete; fixed toast overlay discovery that failed on `adw::ApplicationWindow` internal widget hierarchy
- **libsecret password storage panic** — Fixed `debug_assert` crash in libsecret backend that rejected non-UUID lookup keys (e.g. `"test (vnc)"`); libsecret uses `name (protocol)` format, not UUIDs
- **libsecret password retrieval** — Fixed `is_available()` check that always returned `false` because `secret-tool --version` is not a valid subcommand (exits with code 2); the store path bypassed this check but the retrieve path went through `SecretManager` which skipped the backend, causing saved passwords to never be found on connection
- **VNC/RDP identical icons** — VNC now uses `video-joined-displays-symbolic` (two monitors) instead of `video-display-symbolic` which was identical to RDP's `computer-symbolic` in Adwaita
- **SFTP via mc opens root instead of home** — mc FISH VFS URI now includes `/~` suffix to open the remote user's home directory; mc is launched via `sh -c` wrapper for correct terminal sizing
- **SSH agent not inherited by VTE terminals** — `spawn_command` now injects `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`/`SSH_AGENT_PID` from the global `OnceLock<SshAgentInfo>` into VTE-spawned processes; previously mc, ssh, and other terminal commands could not reach the SSH agent when RustConn started its own agent (Rust 2024 edition forbids `set_var`)

### Improved
- **Client Detection** — Added waypipe to Settings → Clients detection tab
- **Documentation** — Added Waypipe section to User Guide and Architecture docs
- **Translations** — Added waypipe-related strings to all 18 languages

- **Updated**: deflate64 0.1.10→0.1.11, dispatch2 0.3.0→0.3.1, objc2 0.6.3→0.6.4, zerocopy 0.8.39→0.8.40
## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Custom Icons** — Set emoji/unicode or GTK icon names on connections and groups ([#23](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/23))
- **Remote Monitoring** — MobaXterm-style monitoring bar below SSH/Telnet/K8s terminals showing CPU, memory, disk, and network usage from remote Linux hosts; agentless via `/proc/*` parsing; per-connection and global toggle in Settings ([#26](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/26))

### Fixed
- New connections and groups now append to end of list instead of jumping to position 0
- **IronRDP fallback to FreeRDP** — When IronRDP fails during RDP protocol negotiation (e.g. xrdp `ServerDemandActive` incompatibility), the session now auto-falls back to external FreeRDP instead of showing a raw error; shows a user-friendly toast on fallback ([#33](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/33))
- **Monitoring SSH password auth** — Remote monitoring now works with password-authenticated SSH connections via `sshpass`; previously `BatchMode=yes` blocked password auth causing "Permission denied" errors
- **Monitoring error spam** — Monitoring collector now stops after 3 consecutive failures instead of retrying indefinitely and flooding logs
- **Bitwarden CLI not found in Flatpak** — All `bw` command invocations now use a dynamically resolved path instead of hardcoded `"bw"`; `resolve_bw_cmd()` probes Flatpak CLI dir, Snap, `/usr/local/bin`, and `PATH` at startup ([#28](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/28))

### Improved
- **Documentation** — Added User Guide sections for Remote Monitoring and Custom Icons; added monitoring architecture to ARCHITECTURE.md; updated README features table; rewrote Settings section to match the current 4-page `PreferencesDialog` layout (Terminal, Interface, Secrets, Connection); fixed all cross-references to old tab names throughout User Guide; added `docs/BITWARDEN_SETUP.md` step-by-step guide covering Flatpak sandbox, self-hosted servers, API key auth, and troubleshooting
- **Translations** — Completed all 14 language translations to 100% coverage (de, fr, es, it, pl, cs, sk, da, sv, nl, pt, be, kk, uz); added Uzbek (uz) as a new language; fixed corrupted .po file formatting from previous patching

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Command Palette** — VS Code-style quick launcher (`Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) with fuzzy search for connections and `>` / `@` / `#` prefixes for commands, tags, and groups
- **Favorites / Pinning** — Pin connections to a dedicated "Favorites" section at the top of the sidebar via context menu
- **Pass (passwordstore.org) secret backend** — Store and retrieve credentials via `pass` with GPG-encrypted files, custom `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR`, Settings UI, and CLI support ([#32](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/pull/32), contributed by [@h3nnes](https://github.com/h3nnes))
- **Tab coloring by protocol** — Optional colored circle indicator on terminal tabs (SSH=green, RDP=blue, VNC=purple, SPICE=orange, Serial=yellow, K8s=cyan); toggle in Settings → Appearance
- **Snippet timestamps** — `created_at` and `updated_at` fields on `Snippet` model with backward-compatible deserialization
- **Tab grouping** — Right-click context menu on tabs to assign named groups ("Production", "Staging") with color-coded indicators
- **Custom Keybindings** — Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts via Settings → Keybindings with 30+ actions, Record button, per-shortcut Reset, and Reset All

### Fixed
- Command Palette not dismissible via Escape or click-outside
- Favorites group not updating immediately on pin/unpin
- KDBX group visibility regression when loading saved backend preference in Settings
- Doc-comment misplacement in `state.rs` for Pass helper functions

### Improved
- **i18n coverage** — Connection dialog tabs (Basic, Protocol, Data, Logging, Automation, Advanced) and all their content strings now translatable; translations added to all 14 languages
- **User Guide** — Added "Terminal Keybinding Modes" section (vim/emacs in Bash, Zsh, Fish)

- **Updated**: uuid 1.11→1.21, proptest 1.6→1.9, tempfile 3.15→3.23, plus 18 transitive dependency bumps via `cargo update`
### Internal
- Deduplicated `PassBackend` construction in CLI and GUI
- Cached `has_secret_backend()` result in `AppState` to avoid repeated `block_on` calls

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Startup action** — configure which session opens automatically when RustConn starts: local shell, or any saved connection. Set in Settings → Appearance → Startup, or override via CLI flags `--shell` / `--connect <name|uuid>` ([#30](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/30))

### Security
- All password fields (`FreeRdpConfig`, `RdpConfig`, `SpiceClientConfig`, `KdbxEntry`, `PasswordDialogResult`, `ConnectionDialogResult`) migrated to `SecretString` — credentials are now exposed only at point of use
- FreeRDP embedded thread no longer passes password via CLI arg — uses `/from-stdin` + stdin pipe
- Bitwarden `BW_SESSION` replaced with thread-safe in-process `RwLock` storage instead of `set_var`
- KDBX functions migrated to `SecretString` + `SecretResult` throughout
- SSH `custom_options` now filtered against dangerous directives (`ProxyCommand`, `LocalCommand`, etc.) before passing to `ssh -o`
- Hand-rolled base64 in Bitwarden backend replaced with `data-encoding` crate

### Improved
- **Ukrainian translation** — 674 translations professionally reviewed by Mykola Zubkov for accuracy and modern orthography
- SVG icon optimized and simplified per GNOME HIG; 48×48 and 64×64 PNG removed — GTK renders SVG at any size; 128×128 and 256×256 PNG regenerated from SVG
- Welcome page logo now uses GTK themed icon lookup (same as About dialog) — renders SVG at native HiDPI resolution instead of fixed-size raster
- Flathub metainfo.xml overhauled: description condensed, brand colors improved, screenshots replaced with HiDPI windowed captures with shadows, localized screenshots for uk/be/cs, added translate and contribute URLs
- 8 dialogs migrated to `adw::Dialog` (libadwaita 1.5+) with adaptive sizing and proper modal behavior
- Password field uses `PasswordEntry` with built-in peek icon
- Screen reader support: accessible label relations added to password and connection dialogs
- `adw::Clamp` added to dialogs to prevent content stretching on wide screens
- Dialog header bar pattern deduplicated via shared `dialog_header()` helper
- Clear History now requires confirmation via `adw::AlertDialog`
- Search history popover items are now clickable
- All `eprintln!` calls replaced with structured `tracing`

### Fixed
- **VNC RSA-AES auto-fallback** — servers using RSA-AES security type (type 129, e.g. wayvnc) now automatically fall back to external VNC viewer (TigerVNC) instead of showing a raw error. User sees a friendly toast message ([#31](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/31))
- Embedded RDP cursor size corrected on HiDPI displays — server-sent device-pixel bitmaps now downscaled to logical pixels before GTK cursor creation
- Pango markup warning on welcome page — ampersand in "Embedded & external clients" escaped for GTK label rendering
- Variable password source (`PasswordSource::Variable`) now resolves correctly at connection time — `SecretManager` is initialized with backends from settings, and variable lookup uses the same backend as save
- Locale `.mo` files now included in Debian, RPM, and local Flatpak packages
- Debian build no longer enables `spice-embedded` feature without build dependencies
- AppStream metainfo.xml: categories added explicitly (`Network`, `RemoteAccess`), generic `GTK` category removed
- Debian `Recommends` updated for FreeRDP 3 / Wayland support
- Build dependencies corrected for `gettext` across Debian and RPM

### Removed
- Dead code cleanup: unused credential caching, split view adapter methods, toast helpers, deprecated flatpak host command functions

- **Updated**: deranged 0.5.6→0.5.8, js-sys 0.3.86→0.3.88, wasm-bindgen 0.2.109→0.2.111, wasm-bindgen-futures 0.4.59→0.4.61, web-sys 0.3.86→0.3.88
### Internal
- `Project-Id-Version` updated to `0.9.0` in all `.po` files
- Duplicate `SessionResult` type alias removed from `session/manager.rs` — canonical definition in `error.rs`
- Tray stub no longer allocates orphaned `mpsc` channel when `tray` feature is disabled
- Migrated to Rust 2024 edition (167 files changed across all three crates):
  - Eliminated all `unsafe` `set_var`/`remove_var` calls — SSH agent info stored in `OnceLock<SshAgentInfo>` with `apply_agent_env()` helper, language switching via process re-exec with sentinel guard, Bitwarden session token in `RwLock`
  - Renamed `gen` keyword usages to `generator`/`pw_gen`/`counter` in password generator, dialog, and RDP modules
  - Fixed `ref` binding patterns in match arms across source and test files (Rust 2024 match ergonomics)
  - Hundreds of `collapsible_if` patterns rewritten as let-chains (`if let ... && let ...`)
  - Import ordering updated to Rust 2024 `style_edition` rules via `cargo fmt`

## [0.8.9] - 2026-02-20

### Security
- Input validation hardening across all protocols — `custom_args`, device paths, shell paths, hostnames, proxy URLs, and shared folder names are now validated against injection attacks (null bytes, newlines, shell metacharacters, path traversal)
- SSH config export blocks dangerous directives (`ProxyCommand`, `LocalCommand`, etc.) with inline comments
- KeePassXC socket responses capped at 10 MB; reduced password exposure lifetime
- Async import enforces the same 50 MB file size limit as sync path
- VNC and RDP client passwords migrated to `SecretString` — exposed only at point of use
- FreeRDP external launcher uses `/from-stdin` instead of `/p:{password}` on command line

### Added
- **SSH port forwarding** — Local (`-L`), remote (`-R`), and dynamic SOCKS (`-D`) port forwarding rules can be configured per connection; rules are persisted in `SshConfig.port_forwards` and passed as CLI flags to `ssh` ([#22](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/22))
- **Deferred secret backend initialization** — Bitwarden vault unlock and KDBX password decryption now run asynchronously after the main window is presented, eliminating the 1–3 second startup delay when a secret backend is configured

### Fixed
- `localhost` no longer rejected as placeholder during import
- Bitwarden: fixed duplicate vault writes, false "unlocked" status at startup, auto-unlock after restart, and compatibility with CLI v2026.1.0 including automatic `logout → login → unlock` recovery on "key type mismatch" ([#28](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/28))
- Bitwarden GUI unlock no longer clears password field, preventing stale encrypted password on next save ([#28](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/28))
- Generic ZeroTrust `custom_args` now embedded into shell command instead of passed as positional parameters
- RefCell borrow panic in EmbeddedRdpWidget; VNC polling mutex contention; RDP polling timer leak
- FreeRDP now uses native Wayland backend (removed `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` override)
- Several `unwrap()` panics replaced with safe fallbacks (VNC, TaskExecutor, tray, build.rs)
- EmbeddedRdpWidget resize signal handler properly cleaned up on disconnect
- Quick connect RDP fails with "Got empty identity" CredSSP error — NLA is now auto-disabled when username or password is not provided, letting the server prompt for credentials ([#29](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/29))
- Bitwarden vault unlock moved to a background thread — eliminates "application not responding" dialog on startup when Bitwarden is the configured secret backend

### Changed
- **CLI downloads** — Tailscale 1.94.1→1.94.2, Teleport 18.6.8→18.7.0, kubectl 1.35.0→1.35.1
- **Documentation** — Updated README, ARCHITECTURE, and USER_GUIDE with SSH port forwarding and deferred secret backend initialization

### Improved
- ~40 `eprintln!` calls migrated to structured `tracing` across GUI crate
- VNC client warns about unencrypted connections

### Internal
- `tracing` moved to workspace dependencies; deprecated flatpak re-exports removed
- API surface migrated from flat re-exports to modular paths (`rustconn_core::models::*`, etc.)
- Architecture audit: 51 findings, 49 resolved

- **serde_yaml** replaced with **serde_yaml_ng** 0.9 (maintained fork; transparent rename)
- **cpal** `0.17.1` → `0.17.3`
- **clap** `4.5.59` → `4.5.60`
## [0.8.8] - 2026-02-18

### Security
- **AES-256-GCM for stored credentials** — Replaced XOR obfuscation with AES-256-GCM + Argon2id key derivation for KeePassXC, Bitwarden, 1Password, and Passbolt passwords in settings; transparent migration from legacy format on first save
- **FreeRDP password via stdin** — Passwords are now passed using `/from-stdin` instead of `/p:{password}` command-line argument, preventing exposure via `/proc/PID/cmdline`

### Changed
- **FreeRDP detection unified** — Single `detect_best_freerdp()` function with Wayland-first candidate ordering (`wlfreerdp3` → `wlfreerdp` → `xfreerdp3` → `xfreerdp`); all detection paths delegate to it
- **RDP `build_args()` decoupled** — New `build_args()` and `build_command_with_binary()` methods on `RdpProtocol` separate argument construction from binary name; callers determine the binary via runtime detection
- **ZeroTrust validation** — Provider-specific `validate()` on `ZeroTrustConfig` checks required fields (AWS SSM target, GCP IAP instance/zone/project, Teleport cluster, Tailscale hostname, Generic command template) before save
- **ZeroTrust CLI detection** — CLI tool availability (`aws`, `gcloud`, `tsh`, `tailscale`) is verified before connection launch; missing tools show a toast and log a warning
- **ZeroTrust tracing** — Connection launch attempts and failures are now logged via `tracing` in both GUI and CLI paths
- **Native export format v2** — `NativeExport` now includes `snippets` field; backward-compatible with v1 imports via `#[serde(default)]`

- **native-tls** `0.2.14` → `0.2.18` — Removed version pin; 0.2.18 fixes the `Tlsv13` compile error from 0.2.17 ([#367](https://github.com/rust-native-tls/rust-native-tls/issues/367))
- **toml** `0.8` → `1.0` — Major version bump; no API changes required (re-export crate, fully compatible)
- **zip** `2.2` → `8.1` — Major version bump; replaced deprecated `mangled_name()` with `enclosed_name()` which adds path traversal validation
### Fixed
- **RDP HiDPI scaling on 4K displays** — IronRDP now sends `desktop_scale_factor` to the Windows server (e.g. 200% on a 2× display), so remote UI elements render at the correct logical size instead of appearing tiny; previously hardcoded to 0
- **RDP mouse coordinate mismatch on HiDPI** — Widget dimensions used for mouse→RDP coordinate transform now store CSS pixels (matching GTK event coordinates) instead of device pixels, fixing misaligned clicks on scaled displays
### Removed
- **Dashboard module** — Removed unused `ConnectionDashboard` GUI widget, core types (`SessionStats`, `DashboardFilter`), and property tests; session monitoring is handled by Active Sessions manager and sidebar indicators
- **5 dead GUI modules** — Removed `adaptive_tabs.rs`, `empty_state.rs`, `error_display.rs`, `floating_controls.rs`, `loading.rs` (all replaced by native adw/GTK4 equivalents)
- **`tab_split_manager` remnants** — Removed unused field from `MainWindow` and `SharedTabSplitManager` type alias; split view fully handled by `SplitViewBridge`

## [0.8.7] - 2026-02-17

### Security
- **Variable injection prevention** — All variable substitution in command-building paths now validates resolved values, rejecting null bytes, newlines, and control characters to prevent command injection
- **Checksum policy for CLI downloads** — Replaced placeholder SHA256 strings with `ChecksumPolicy` enum (`Static`, `SkipLatest`, `None`) for explicit integrity verification
- **Sensitive CLI arguments masked** — Password-like arguments (`/p:`, `--password`, `token=`, etc.) are masked in log output
- **Configurable document encryption** — `EncryptionStrength` enum (Standard/High/Maximum) with per-level Argon2 parameters; backward-compatible with legacy format
- **SSH Agent passphrase handling** — `add_key()` now uses `SSH_ASKPASS` helper script with `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force` to securely pass passphrases to `ssh-add` without PTY; temporary script is cleaned up immediately after use

### Added
- **Internationalization (i18n)** — gettext support via `gettext-rs` with system libintl; `i18n` module with `i18n()`, `i18n_f()`, `ni18n()` helpers; translations for 14 languages: uk, de, fr, es, it, pl, cs, sk, da, sv, nl, pt, be, kk; closes [#17](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/17)
- **SPICE proxy support** — `SpiceConfig.proxy` field stores proxy URL from virt-viewer `.vv` imports; `remote-viewer` receives `--spice-proxy` flag for Proxmox VE tunnelled connections; fixes [#18](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/18)
- **RDP HiDPI fix** — IronRDP embedded client now multiplies widget dimensions by `scale_factor()` to negotiate device-pixel resolution on HiDPI displays, eliminating blurry upscaling; fixes [#16](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/16)
- **Property tests for variable injection** — 8 proptest properties validating command injection prevention
- **CLI delete confirmation** — Interactive prompt with `--force` flag to skip
- **CLI `--verbose` / `--quiet`** — Global flags for controlling output verbosity
- **CLI `--no-color` / `NO_COLOR`** — Per [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) convention

- **CLI `--dry-run` for connect** — Prints command without executing
- **CLI pager for long output** — Pipes through `less` when output exceeds 40 lines
- **CLI auto-JSON when piped** — List commands switch to JSON when stdout is not a terminal
- **CLI fuzzy suggestions** — "Did you mean: x, y, z?" on connection name mismatch
- **CLI man page generation** — `man-page` subcommand via `clap_mangen`
- **Ctrl+M "Move to Group"** — Keyboard shortcut for moving sidebar items between groups
- **Search history navigation** — Up/Down arrows cycle through sidebar search history
- **CI version check workflow** — Weekly GitHub Action checks upstream CLI versions
- **Client detection caching** — 5-minute cache for CLI version checks
- **Flathub x-checker-data** — Automated dependency tracking for vte, libsecret, inetutils, picocom, mc
- **Flathub device metadata** — `<requires>`, `<recommends>`, `<supports>` in metainfo.xml

### Fixed
- **CLI `--config` flag** — Was declared but never used; now threads through all 43 `ConfigManager` call sites
- **Flatpak components dialog** — Hides unusable protocol clients in sandbox; shows only network-compatible tools
- **SPDX license** — `GPL-3.0+` → `GPL-3.0-or-later` in metainfo.xml

### Changed
- **VTE** — Flatpak manifests use VTE 0.78.7 (LTS branch for GNOME 46/47); `vte4` Rust crate 0.9 with `v0_72` feature
- **CLI modularized** — Split 5000+ line `main.rs` into 18 handler modules
- **CLI structured logging** — `tracing` replaces `eprintln!` with `--verbose`/`--quiet` control
- **VNC viewer list deduplicated** — Single `VNC_VIEWERS` constant shared across detection
- **Protocol icon mapping unified** — `get_protocol_icon_by_name()` in core replaces duplicate match blocks
- **Protocol command building unified** — `Protocol::build_command()` trait; CLI delegates to `ProtocolRegistry`
- **Send Text dialog** — Migrated to `adw::Dialog` per GNOME HIG
- **Sidebar minimum width** — Reduced from 200px to 160px
- **Tray polling optimized** — Split into 50ms message handling + 2s state sync with dirty-flag tracking

### Deprecated
- **Flatpak host command functions** — `host_command()`, `host_has_command()`, etc. in `flatpak.rs`; `flatpak-spawn --host` disabled since 0.7.7

### Improved
- **Accessible labels** — Added to 20+ icon-only buttons for screen reader compatibility
- **Czech translation (cs)** — Native speaker review by [p-bo](https://github.com/p-bo); 45 translations improved ([PR #19](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/pull/19))
- **Remmina RDP import** — Now imports `gateway_server`, `gateway_username`, and `domain` fields from Remmina RDP profiles ([#20](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/20))

## [0.8.6] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- **Embedded RDP keyboard layout** — Fixed incorrect key mapping for non-US keyboard layouts (e.g. German QWERTZ) in IronRDP embedded client ([#15](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/15))
- **Secrets management** — Comprehensive fixes to vault credential storage, backend dispatch, and Bitwarden integration ([#14](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/14)):
  - All vault operations now respect `Settings → Secrets → preferred_backend` instead of being hardcoded to libsecret
  - Bitwarden encrypted password is decrypted and vault auto-unlocked at startup when preferred backend is Bitwarden
  - `PasswordSource::Inherit` resolves group passwords through non-KeePass backends with correct hierarchy traversal
  - RDP and VNC password prompts auto-save entered passwords to vault when `password_source == Vault`
  - Toast notifications shown on all vault save error paths

- **Flatpak component uninstall/reinstall** — Fixed `AlreadyInstalled` error when reinstalling AWS CLI and Google Cloud CLI
- **Terminal search Highlight All** — Fixed checkbox toggling to next match instead of highlighting

### Changed
- **Dependencies** — Updated: `futures` 0.3.31→0.3.32, `libc` 0.2.181→0.2.182, `uuid` 1.20.0→1.21.0, `bitflags` 2.10.0→2.11.0, `syn` 2.0.114→2.0.116, `native-tls` 0.2.14→0.2.16, `png` 0.18.0→0.18.1, `cc` 1.2.55→1.2.56

## [0.8.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Kubernetes Protocol** — Shell access to Kubernetes pods via `kubectl exec -it` ([#14](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/14)):
  - `KubernetesConfig` model with kubeconfig, context, namespace, pod, container, shell, busybox toggle

- **Flatpak libsecret Crypto Option** — Renamed `gcrypt` to `crypto`
- **Thread Safety** — Removed `std::env::set_var` from FreeRDP spawned thread
- **Flatpak Machine Key** — App-specific key file in `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
- **Variables Dialog Panic** — Replaced `expect()` with `if let Some(window)` pattern
- **Keyring `secret-tool` Check** — Returns `SecretError::BackendUnavailable` if not installed
- **Flatpak CLI Paths** — No longer adds hardcoded paths when running inside Flatpak
- **Settings Dialog Performance** — Moved all detection to background threads; dialog opens instantly
- **Settings Clients Tab Performance** — Parallelized CLI detection; ~15s → ~3s
- **Settings Dialog Visual Render Blocking** — Replaced `glib::spawn_future` with `std::thread::spawn` + `glib::idle_add_local`

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Shared Keyring Module** — Generic `store()`, `lookup()`, `clear()` for all secret backends
- **Keyring Support for All Backends** — Bitwarden, 1Password, Passbolt, KeePassXC
- **Auto-Load Credentials from Keyring** — Automatic restore on settings load
- **Flatpak `secret-tool` Support** — `libsecret` 0.21.7 as Flatpak build module
- **Passbolt Server URL Setting** — New field in `SecretSettings`
- **Unified Credential Save Options** — Consistent "Save password" / "Save to keyring" across all backends

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Passbolt Secret Backend** — Passbolt password manager integration ([#6](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/6)):
  - `PassboltBackend` implementing `SecretBackend` trait via `go-passbolt-cli`
  - Store, retrieve, and delete credentials as Passbolt resources
  - CLI detection and version display in Settings → Secrets
  - Server configuration status check (configured/not configured/auth failed)
  - `PasswordSource::Passbolt` option in connection dialog password source dropdown
  - `SecretBackendType::Passbolt` option in settings backend selector
  - Credential resolution and rename support in `CredentialResolver`
  - Requires `passbolt configure` CLI setup before use

### Changed
- **Unified Secret Backends** — Replaced individual `PasswordSource` variants (KeePass, Keyring, Bitwarden, OnePassword, Passbolt) with single `Vault` variant:
  - Connection dialog password source dropdown: Prompt, Vault, Variable, Inherit, None
  - Serde aliases preserve backward compatibility with existing configs
  - `PasswordSource` is now `Clone` only (no longer `Copy`) due to `Variable(String)`
- **Variable Password Source** — New `PasswordSource::Variable(String)` reads credentials from a named secret global variable:
  - Connection dialog shows variable dropdown when "Variable" is selected
  - Dropdown populated with secret global variables only
- **Variables Dialog Improvements** — Show/Hide and Load from Vault buttons for secret variables:
  - Toggle password visibility with `view-reveal-symbolic`/`view-conceal-symbolic` icon
  - Load secret value from vault with key `rustconn/var/{name}`
  - Secret variable values auto-saved to vault on dialog save, cleared from settings file

### Fixed
- **Secret Variable Vault Backend** — Fixed secret variables always using libsecret instead of configured backend:
  - Save/load secret variable values now respects Settings → Secrets backend (KeePassXC, libsecret)
  - Added `save_variable_to_vault()` and `load_variable_from_vault()` functions using settings snapshot
  - Toast notification on vault save/load failure with message to check Settings
- **Variable Dropdown Empty in Connection Dialog** — Fixed Variable dropdown showing "(Немає)" when editing connections:
  - `set_global_variables()` was never called when creating/editing connections
  - Added call to all three `ConnectionDialog` creation sites (new, edit, template)
  - Edit dialog: `set_global_variables()` called before `set_connection()` so variable selection works
- **Telnet Backspace/Delete Key Handling** — Fixed keyboard settings not working correctly for Telnet connections ([#5](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/5)):
  - Replaced `stty erase` shell wrapper approach with VTE native `EraseBinding` API
  - Backspace/Delete settings now applied directly on the VTE terminal widget before process spawn
  - `Automatic` mode uses VTE defaults (termios for Backspace, VT220 `\e[3~` for Delete)
  - `Backspace (^H)` sends ASCII `0x08`, `Delete (^?)` sends ASCII `0x7F` as expected
  - Fixes Delete key showing `3~` escape artifacts on servers that don't support VT220 sequences
- **Split View Panel Sizing** — Fixed left panel shrinking when splitting vertically then horizontally:
  - Use model's fractional position (0.0–1.0) instead of hardcoded `size / 2` for divider placement
  - Disable `shrink_start_child`/`shrink_end_child` to prevent panels from collapsing below minimum size
  - One-shot position initialization via `connect_map` prevents repeated resets on widget remap
  - Save user-dragged divider positions back to the model via `connect_notify_local("position")`
  - Each split now correctly divides the current panel in half without affecting other panels

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Telnet Backspace/Delete Configuration** — Configurable keyboard behavior for Telnet connections ([#5](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/5)):
  - `TelnetBackspaceSends` and `TelnetDeleteSends` enums with Automatic/Backspace/Delete options
  - Connection dialog Keyboard group with two dropdowns for Backspace and Delete key behavior
  - `stty erase` shell wrapper in `spawn_telnet()` to apply key settings before connecting
  - Addresses common backspace/delete inversion issue reported by users
- **Flatpak Telnet Support** — GNU inetutils built as Flatpak module:
  - `telnet` binary available at `/app/bin/` in Flatpak sandbox
  - Built from inetutils 2.7 source with `--disable-servers` (client tools only)
  - Added to all three Flatpak manifests (flatpak, flatpak-local, flathub)

### Changed
- **Dependencies** — Updated: `libc` 0.2.180→0.2.181, `tempfile` 3.24.0→3.25.0, `unicode-ident` 1.0.22→1.0.23

### Fixed
- **OBS Screenshot Display** — Updated `_service` revision from `v0.5.3` to current version tag for proper AppStream metadata processing on software.opensuse.org
- **Flatpak AWS CLI** — Replaced `awscliv2` pip package (Docker wrapper) with official AWS CLI v2 binary installer from `awscli.amazonaws.com`; `aws --version` now shows real AWS CLI instead of Docker error
- **Flatpak Component Detection** — Fixed SSM Plugin, Azure CLI, and OCI CLI showing as "Not installed" after installation:
  - Added explicit search paths for SSM Plugin (`usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin/bin`) and AWS CLI (`v2/current/bin`)
  - Increased recursive binary search depth from 3 to 5/6 levels
- **Flatpak Python Version** — Wrapper scripts for pip-installed CLIs (Azure CLI, OCI CLI) now dynamically detect Python version instead of hardcoding `python3.13`

## [0.7.9] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Telnet Protocol Support** — Full Telnet protocol implementation across all crates ([#5](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/5)):
  - Core model: `TelnetConfig`, `ProtocolType::Telnet`, `ProtocolConfig::Telnet` with configurable host, port (default 23), and extra arguments
  - Protocol trait implementation with external `telnet` client
  - Import support: Remmina, Asbru, MobaXterm, RDM importers recognize Telnet connections
  - Export support: Remmina, Asbru, MobaXterm exporters write Telnet connections
  - CLI: `rustconn-cli telnet` subcommand with `--host`, `--port`, `--extra-args` options
  - GUI: Connection dialog with Telnet-specific configuration tab
  - Template dialog: Telnet protocol option with default port 23
  - Sidebar: Telnet filter button with `network-wired-symbolic` icon
  - Terminal: `spawn_telnet()` method for launching telnet sessions
  - Quick Connect: Telnet protocol option in quick connect bar
  - Cluster dialog: Telnet connections selectable for cluster membership
  - Property tests: All existing property tests updated with Telnet coverage

### Fixed
- **Sidebar Icon Missing** — Added missing `"telnet"` mapping in sidebar `get_protocol_icon()` function; Telnet connections now display the correct icon in the connection tree
- **Telnet Icon Mismatch** — Changed Telnet protocol icon from `network-wired-symbolic` to `call-start-symbolic` across all views (sidebar, filter buttons, dialogs, templates); the previous icon resembled a shield in breeze-dark theme, which was misleading for an insecure protocol
- **ZeroTrust Sidebar Icon** — Unified ZeroTrust sidebar icon to `folder-remote-symbolic` for all providers; previously showed provider-specific icons that were inconsistent with the filter button icon

## [0.7.8] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Remmina Password Import** — Importing from Remmina now automatically transfers saved passwords into the configured secret backend (libsecret, KeePassXC, etc.); connections are marked with `PasswordSource::Keyring` so credentials resolve seamlessly on first connect

### Fixed
- **Import Error Swallowing** — Replaced 14 `.unwrap_or_default()` calls in import dialog with proper error propagation; import failures now display user-friendly messages instead of silently returning empty results
- **MobaXterm Import Double Allocation** — Removed unnecessary `.clone()` on byte buffer during UTF-8 conversion; recovers original bytes from error on fallback path instead of cloning upfront

### Improved
- **Import File Size Guard** — Added 50 MB file size limit check in `read_import_file()` to prevent OOM on accidentally selected large files
- **Native Export Streaming I/O** — `NativeExport::to_file()` now uses `BufWriter` with `serde_json::to_writer_pretty()` instead of serializing entire JSON to `String` first; eliminates intermediate allocation
- **Native Import Streaming I/O** — `NativeExport::from_file()` now uses `BufReader` with `serde_json::from_reader()` instead of reading entire file to `String`; reduces peak memory by ~50%
- **Native Import Version Pre-Check** — Version validation now runs before full deserialization; rejects unsupported format versions without parsing all connections and groups
- **Export File Writing** — Added centralized `write_export_file()` helper with `BufWriter` for consistent buffered writes across all exporters

### Refactored
- **Export Write Consolidation** — Replaced duplicated `fs::write` + error mapping boilerplate in SSH config, Ansible, Remmina, Asbru, Royal TS, and MobaXterm exporters with shared `write_export_file()` helper
- **TOCTOU Elimination** — Removed redundant `path.exists()` checks before file reads in importers; the subsequent `read_import_file()` already returns `ImportError` on failure
- **Unused Imports Cleanup** — Removed unused `ExportError` import from Asbru exporter and moved `std::fs` import to `#[cfg(test)]` in MobaXterm exporter

- Updated `memchr` 2.7.6 → 2.8.0
- Updated `ryu` 1.0.22 → 1.0.23
- Updated `zerocopy` 0.8.38 → 0.8.39
- Updated `zmij` 1.0.19 → 1.0.20
## [0.7.7] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — `Delete`, `Ctrl+E`, and `Ctrl+D` no longer intercept input when VTE terminal or embedded viewers have focus; these shortcuts now only activate from the sidebar ([#4](https://github.com/totoshko88/RustConn/issues/4))

### Improved
- **Thread Safety** — Audio mutex locks use graceful fallback instead of `unwrap()`, preventing potential panics in real-time audio callbacks
- **Thread Safety** — Search engine mutex locks use graceful recovery patterns throughout `DebouncedSearchEngine`
- **Security** — VNC client logs a warning when connection is attempted without a password

### Refactored
- **Runtime Consolidation** — Replaced 23 redundant `tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()` calls across GUI code with shared `with_runtime()` pattern, reducing resource overhead
- **Collection Optimization** — Snippet tag collection uses `flat_map` with `iter().cloned()` instead of `clone()`, and `sort_unstable()` for better performance
- **Dead Code Removal** — Removed 3 deprecated blocking credential methods from `AppState` (`store_credentials`, `retrieve_credentials`, `delete_credentials`)
- **Dead Code Removal** — Removed unused `build_pane_context_menu` from `MainWindow`

## [0.7.6] - 2026-02-07

  - SHA256 checksum verification (except AWS SSM Plugin which uses "latest" URL)
  - Settings → Clients detects CLIs installed via Flatpak Components

- **Snap Strict Confinement** — Migrated from classic to strict confinement:
  - Snap-aware path resolution for data, config, and SSH directories
  - Interface connection detection with user-friendly messages
  - Uses embedded clients (IronRDP, vnc-rs, spice-gtk) — no bundled external CLIs
  - External CLIs accessed from host via `system-files` interface

### Changed
- **Flatpak Permissions** — Simplified security model:
  - Removed `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak` (no host command access)

- **Snap Package** — Strict confinement with host CLI access:
  - Added plugs for ssh-keys, personal-files, system-files
  - Data stored in `~/snap/rustconn/current/`
  - Smaller package (~50 MB) using host-installed binaries

- **Settings → Clients** — Improved client detection display:
  - All protocols (SSH, RDP, VNC, SPICE) show embedded client status
  - Blue indicator (●) for embedded clients, green (✓) for external

  - Follows GNOME HIG guidelines for proper libadwaita input field usage

### Refactored
- **Import File I/O** - Extracted common file reading pattern into `read_import_file()` helper:
  - Reduces code duplication across 5 import sources (SSH config, Ansible, Remmina, Asbru, Royal TS)
  - Consistent error handling with `ImportError::ParseError`
  - Added async variant `read_import_file_async()` for future use
- **Protocol Client Errors** - Consolidated duplicate error types into unified `EmbeddedClientError`:

  - Added direct KeePass lookup for group credentials in `resolve_credentials_blocking`
- **GTK Widget Parenting** - Fixed `gtk_widget_set_parent` assertion failure in split view:
  - `set_panel_content` now checks if widget has parent before calling `unparent()`

  - Improved `Regex`-based search logic

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Asbru Import Nested Groups** - Fixed group hierarchy being lost when importing from Asbru-CM:
  - Groups with subgroups (e.g., Group1 containing Group11, Group12, etc.) now correctly preserve parent-child relationships
  - Previously, HashMap iteration order caused child groups to be processed before their parents were added to the UUID map, resulting in orphaned root-level groups
  - Now uses two-pass algorithm: first creates all groups and populates UUID map, then resolves parent references

  - `STANDARD_RESOLUTIONS` and `find_best_standard_resolution` from `embedded_rdp.rs`
  - `connect_kdbx_enable_switch` from `dialogs/settings.rs` (extended version exists)
  - `update_reconnect_button_visibility` from `embedded_rdp.rs`
  - `as_selection_model` from `sidebar.rs`

- Removed `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets` from Flatpak manifest (unnecessary D-Bus permission)
- Refactored `dialogs/export.rs`: extracted `do_export()` and `format_result_summary()` to eliminate code duplication

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- RDP clipboard file transfer support (`CF_HDROP` format):
  - `ClipboardFileInfo` struct for file metadata (name, size, attributes, timestamps)
  - `ClipboardFileList`, `ClipboardFileContents`, `ClipboardFileSize` events
  - `RequestFileContents` command for requesting file data from server
  - `FileGroupDescriptorW` parsing for Windows file list format (MS-RDPECLIP 2.2.5.2.3.1)
- RDPDR directory change notifications (`ServerDriveNotifyChangeDirectoryRequest`):
  - Basic acknowledgment support (inotify integration pending)
  - `PendingNotification` struct for tracking watch requests
- RDPDR file locking support (`ServerDriveLockControlRequest`):
  - Basic acknowledgment for byte-range lock requests
  - `FileLock` struct for lock state tracking (advisory locking)

### Changed
- Audio playback: replaced `Mutex<f32>` with `AtomicU32` for volume control (lock-free audio callback)
- Search engine: optimized fuzzy matching to avoid string allocations (30-40% faster for large lists)
- Credential operations: use thread-local cached tokio runtime instead of creating new one each time

### Fixed
- SSH Agent key discovery now finds all private keys in `~/.ssh/`, not just `id_*` files:
  - Detects `.pem` and `.key` extensions
  - Reads file headers to identify private keys (e.g., `google_compute_engine`)
  - Skips known non-key files (`known_hosts`, `config`, `authorized_keys`)
- Native SPICE protocol embedding using `spice-client` crate 0.2.0 (optional `spice-embedded` feature)
  - Direct framebuffer rendering without external processes
  - Keyboard and mouse input forwarding via Inputs channel
  - Automatic fallback to external viewer (remote-viewer, virt-viewer, spicy) when native fails
  - Note: Clipboard and USB redirection not yet available in native mode (crate limitation)
- Real-time connection status indicators in the sidebar (green/red dots) to show connected/disconnected state
- Support for custom cursors in RDP sessions (server-side cursor updates)
- Full integration of "Expect" automation engine:
  - Regex-based pattern matching on terminal output
  - Automatic response injection
  - Support for "one-shot" triggers
- Terminal improvements:
  - Added context menu (Right-click) with Copy, Paste, and Select All options
  - Added keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+C (Copy) and Ctrl+Shift+V (Paste)
- Refactored `Connection` model to support extensible automation configuration (`AutomationConfig`)

### Changed
- Updated `thiserror` from 1.0 to 2.0 (backwards compatible, no API changes required)
- Note: `picky` remains pinned at `=7.0.0-rc.17` due to sspi 0.16.0 incompatibility with newer versions

### Removed
- Unused FFI mock implementations for RDP and SPICE protocols (`rustconn-core/src/ffi/rdp.rs`, `rustconn-core/src/ffi/spice.rs`)
- Unused RDP and SPICE session widget modules (`rustconn/src/session/rdp.rs`, `rustconn/src/session/spice.rs`)

### Fixed
- Connection status indicator disappearing when closing one of multiple sessions for the same connection (now tracks session count per connection)
- System tray menu intermittently not appearing (reduced lock contention and debounced D-Bus updates)

## [0.4.2] - 2025-12-25

### Fixed
- Asbru-CM import now correctly parses installed Asbru configuration (connections inside `environments` key)
- Application icon now properly resolves in all installation scenarios (system, Flatpak, local, development)

### Changed
- Icon theme search paths extended to support multiple installation methods

## [0.4.1] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- IronRDP audio backend (RDPSND) with PCM format support (48kHz, 44.1kHz, 22.05kHz)

### Changed
- Upgraded `ironrdp` to version 0.13 (async API support).
- Refactored `rustconn-core` to improve code organization and maintainability.
- Made `spice-embedded` feature mandatory for better integration.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-23

### Changed
- Code cleanup: fixed all Clippy warnings (pedantic, nursery)
- Applied rustfmt formatting across all crates
- Added Deactivation-Reactivation sequence handling for RDP sessions

### Fixed
- Removed sensitive clipboard debug logging (security improvement)
- Fixed nested if statements and match patterns in RDPDR module

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- IronRDP clipboard integration for embedded RDP sessions (bidirectional copy/paste)
- IronRDP shared folders (RDPDR) support for embedded RDP sessions
- RemoteFX codec support for better RDP image quality
- RDPSND channel (required for RDPDR per MS-RDPEFS spec)

### Changed
- Migrated IronRDP dependencies from GitHub to crates.io (version 0.11)
- Reduced verbose logging in RDPDR module (now uses tracing::debug/trace)

### Fixed
- Pinned sspi to 0.16.0 and picky to 7.0.0-rc.16 to avoid rand_core conflicts
